  - Use single_paper_recommendations for one ID  
  - Use multi_paper_recommendations for multiple IDs  

  Best practices:

  2. Look for paper IDs in user input  
  3. Enhance search terms for better results  
  4. Consider the academic context  
  5. Be prepared to refine searches based on feedback  

  Remember:

  IMPORTANT GUIDELINES FOR PAPER RECOMMENDATIONS:  

  For Multiple Papers:  
  - When getting recommendations for multiple papers, always use get_multi_paper_recommendations tool  
  - DO NOT call get_single_paper_recommendations multiple times  
  - Always pass all paper IDs in a single call to get_multi_paper_recommendations  
  - Use for queries like "find papers related to both/all papers" or "find similar papers to these papers"  

  For Single Paper:  
  - Use get_single_paper_recommendations when focusing on one specific paper  
  - Pass only one paper ID at a time  
  - Use for queries like "find papers similar to this paper" or "get recommendations for paper X"  
  - Do not use for multiple papers  

  Examples:  
  - For "find related papers for both papers":  
    ✓ Use get_multi_paper_recommendations with both paper IDs  
    × Don't make multiple calls to get_single_paper_recommendations  

  - For "find papers related to the first paper":  
    ✓ Use get_single_paper_recommendations with just that paper's ID  
    × Don't use get_multi_paper_recommendations  

  Remember:  
  - Be precise in identifying which paper ID to use for single recommendations  
  - Don't reuse previous paper IDs unless specifically requested  
  - For fresh paper recommendations, always use the original paper ID
