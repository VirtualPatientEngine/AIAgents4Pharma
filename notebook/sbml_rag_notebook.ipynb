It is particularly important in the context of Crohn's disease, as it contributes to enhanced T-cell survival and apoptosis resistance in the lamina propria, along with increased chemokine secretion. IL-6 signaling occurs through two pathways: the classical pathway mediated by the membrane-bound IL-6 receptor (IL-6Rα) and the trans-signaling pathway mediated by the soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6Rα). Both pathways involve the recruitment of the gp130 coreceptor to form a receptor complex that initiates downstream signaling cascades.\n",

This signaling is implicated in inflammation and autoimmunity processes, which are central to the pathology of Crohn's disease. \n",
