## GitHub Repo Creation Workflow

In the table, you will find step-by-step instructions on how to fork a repo from the VPE team account to your private account, and then clone it onto your local machine for coding/development purposes.

| Step                                                                                                                                | How to do?                                                                                                                                                                              |

## How to open and close a Pull request (PR)

### Some general recommendations

1. Assign a single PR to each task. Avoid including unrelated changes in the same pull request to maintain focus and clarity.
2. Title and description serve as the initial means to explain the rationale behind each change.
3. Clearly state the purpose and objectives of the pull request to provide context for reviewers.
4. Break down changes into logically organized, bite-sized commits for easier review.
5. Ensure that each commit follows consistent coding conventions and standards (see the section on Coding practices in the CodeOps guide).
6. Include comprehensive test cases that cover both positive and negative scenarios (and edge/corner cases) and run them locally before creating the PR (see the section on Automated workflows for testing, documentation, and release in this guide).
7. Provide documentation updates alongside code changes to keep it synchronized (see the section on MkDocs for documentation in this guide)

### To open a PR, authors are required to:

1. Provide a title and description of the PR.
2. Make sure the change checks every item mentioned on the checklist in the PR template. If not, please specify the reasons in your PR.

### To close a PR, reviewers are required to:

1. Make sure the PR passes the automated tests (if applicable).
2. Make sure every item mentioned on your checklist in the template is addressed.
3. Please make sure to add a prefix (feat:/fix:/chore:) and/or a suffix BREAKING CHANGE (if it's a major release) to your commit message.

![1](./devops_2.png)<br>
For instance, the commit message triggers a merge followed by the automated activation of the versioning tool (semantics-release). This tool increments the minor version (e.g., 2.1.1 changes to 2.2.0).

![3](./devops_3.png)<br>
Another instance, the commit message triggers a merge followed by the automated activation of the versioning tool (semantics-release). This tool increments the major version (e.g., 2.1.1 changes to 3.0.0).

4. If the PR closes an issue(s), please make sure to state it in your commit message.

![4](./devops_4.png)<br>
For instance, the commit message below triggers a merge followed by the automated activation of the versioning tool (semantics-release) and automatically closes issue #24.

5. Merging into main is supposed to run an automated release workflow, please make sure to check under the Actions tab to see if the workflow has been initiated and return later to verify that it has completed successfully.

## Environment

This repository uses UV for fast, reproducible environments and dependency management.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- UV installed (see https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- For Streamlit file security: `libmagic` system library
  - macOS: `brew install libmagic`
  - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install libmagic1`

### Setup (Recommended)

```
# From repo root
uv sync --extra dev --frozen

# Install pre-commit hooks
uv run pre-commit install

# Verify
uv run python -c "import aiagents4pharma; print('OK')"
```

### Common Tasks

```
# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Lint/format
uv run ruff check --fix .
uv run ruff format .
uv run pylint aiagents4pharma/

# Coverage
uv run coverage run -m pytest && uv run coverage report -m

# Docs (local)
uv run mkdocs serve
```

If you prefer a plain venv, you can still use `python -m venv .venv` and `pip install -e .`, but UV is the supported path and used in CI.

### Legacy venv

Here's a quick documentation on how to install a Python environment using venv:

1.  Create a Virtual Environment:

        1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
        2. Navigate to your project directory.
        3. Run the following command to create a virtual environment: `python -m venv env`
        4. This command creates a folder named `env` which contains the isolated Python environment.

2.  Activate the Virtual Environment:

        1. Activate the virtual environment by running the appropriate command based on your operating system: `.\env\Scripts\activate` (Windows) `source env/bin/activate` (MacOS and Linux)
        2. After activation, you'll notice `(env)` at the beginning of your command prompt, indicating that you are now working within the virtual environment.

3.  Install dependencies: with the virtual environment activated, you can now install Python packages without affecting the global Python installation. Install the required packages using `pip`. For example: `pip install package1 package2`
4.  Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5.  Save dependencies to `requirements.txt` (useful when setting up a project for the first time after installing several libraries via pip): `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

_NOTE: By default, when you run git clone, it clones the entire repository, including all branches. However, it typically checks out the main branch after cloning_. If you want to install the package from a specific branch, either simply checkout to the branch: `git checkout develop`. Or use the -b flag followed by the branch name during git clone: `git clone -b develop https://github.com/VirtualPatientEngine/demo.git`.

6. Verify installation: `pip list`
7. Deactivate the Virtual Environment and return to the global Python environment, simply run: `deactivate`

That's it! You've successfully installed a Python environment using `venv` and recreated an existing environment from `requirements.txt`.

## CI/CD pipeline

Our CI/CD uses GitHub Actions with a UV-first setup for speed and reproducibility.

![5](./devops_5.jpg)<br>

### Development

- Branch from `main`; use Conventional Commits in PRs.
- Run local checks with `uv run` to mirror CI.

### GitHub Actions (Key Phases)

1. Install dependencies with UV (`--frozen`) and set up Python 3.12.
2. Test matrix (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows) with coverage artifact upload and Codecov (Ubuntu).
3. Lint/format (ruff), static analysis (pylint), security scans (bandit, pip-audit, safety).
4. SonarCloud analysis using artifacts from test workflows; quality gates enforce coverage and duplication.
5. Docs build and deploy (MkDocs Material with mkdocs-jupyter) to GitHub Pages.
6. Docker images build/push; package build/validation; semantic-release for versioning, tags, PyPI publish, and GitHub releases.

## MkDocs for Documentation

### Why MkDocs?

1. MkDocs produces static pages from Markdown.
2. It pulls in code documentation from docstrings using a plug-in mkdocstrings.
3. Offers various themes to make your documentation look pretty.
4. Host your documentation on GitHub Pages
5. Automate code documentation using GitHub Actions

### How to implement MkDocs?

#### Docstrings

Make sure for every method and class you define, there is a docstring (would be awesome if you specify the examples, arguments and returns in the docstring ‚Äì mkdocs can fetch that info too!)

```
def __init__(self, gnn_model,
               training_data,
               validation_data
               ) -> None:
       '''
       Initializes the link predictor model

       Args:
           gnn_model(GCNConv): The GNN model to be used for training (GraphAutoEncoder)
           training_data(torch_geometric.data.Data): The training data (PyG Data)
           validation_data(torch_geometric.data.Data): The validation data (PyG Data)

       Returns:
           None
       '''
```

![6](./devops_6.png)<br>
The above docstring should produce the image in the documentation.

#### In the docs/ folder:

1. Create an index.md file that contains information to be shown on the index page of the documentation.
2. Next, create a markdown file for every class or set of methods you want to document.
3. Within each markdown file, specify the name of the class or set of methods you want to be automatically read `:::folderName.module` e.g.: `:::tests.uniprot` where tests is a folder that contains the module _uniprot.py_. Note: You can also add additional text (in markdown format) in the file besides the syntax above
4. Open the file mkdocs.yml Add the paths to folders that contain the python code you want to document under the plugins (‚Äúapp‚Äù & ‚Äútests‚Äù are added by default)
5. Under nav (navigation), set `<pageName>: <file.md>` where pageName is the name of the page you‚Äôd like to assign and _file.md_ is the file you created for the corresponding class/methods in the previous step. NOTE: You'll need to create the markdown files initially to set up a template. Afterwards, you'll only need to do this again if you've added a new script file or made significant modifications.

#### To view it locally

run `uv run mkdocs serve` in your terminal.

## Automated workflows for testing, documentation, and release

- Workflows live in `.github/workflows` and are triggered by PRs, pushes to `main`, schedules, or manual dispatch.
- All workflows use UV for dependency management and produce artifacts consumed by downstream jobs.
- Run the same checks locally with the commands in the Environment section to save CI cycles.

### Testing Workflows (per component)

- `tests_talk2aiagents4pharma.yml`, `tests_talk2biomodels.yml`, `tests_talk2knowledgegraphs.yml`, `tests_talk2scholars.yml`, `tests_talk2cells.yml`
  - Cross-platform matrix (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows) on Python 3.12
  - Run pytest with coverage; upload `coverage.xml`
  - Lint (ruff), static analysis (pylint), security (bandit)
  - Codecov upload on Ubuntu

### Security & Quality

- `security_audit.yml` (weekly + on changes): `pip-audit` and `safety` with SARIF upload to GitHub Security
- `sonarcloud.yml`: artifact-based analysis using coverage and quality reports from test workflows; quality gates enforce coverage and duplication thresholds

### Build & Release

- `docker_build.yml`: build and push agent images (CPU/GPU variants)
- `docker_compose_release.yml`: compose release automation
- `package_build.yml`: build and validate wheel/sdist, cross-platform install tests
- `release.yml`: semantic-release (feat/fix/BREAKING CHANGE) ‚Üí version bump, tag, PyPI publish, GitHub release

### Documentation

- `mkdocs_deploy.yml`: build docs (Material, mkdocs-jupyter) and deploy to GitHub Pages

### Required GitHub Secrets

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (tests requiring LLM access)
- `ZOTERO_API_KEY`, `ZOTERO_USER_ID` (Talk2Scholars)
- `CODECOV_TOKEN` (coverage reporting)
- `SONAR_TOKEN` (SonarCloud)
- `PYPI_API_TOKEN` (releases)
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` (auto-provided by GitHub)

### Notes

- Prefer updating rules and thresholds in `pyproject.toml` so local/CI behavior is consistent.
- Some LLM tests include fallback behavior for non-determinism or limited access; review test logs if failures are environment-specific.
- We store our workflows in the `.github/workflows` directory, consistent with the workflows described in the _Testing Locally_ section of the CodeOps guide.
- To save resources and time, **we encourage you to run them locally before opening a PR.**
