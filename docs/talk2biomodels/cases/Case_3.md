<hr>

### Model simulation

**Q3:** What is the concentration of Mpp at a steady state? <br>

```
What is the concentration of Mpp at a steady state and what is its transition time until the steady state is reached?
```

<hr>

### Emergent model behavior (hysteresis)

**Q4:** Observe the steady state concentration of Mpp if the Mpp is in "ON" state.<br>

```
Set initial concentration of MAPKK to 50, Mpp to 350 and M to 150, and then bring the model to a steady state. Call this experiment_on.
```

```
What is the steady state concentration of Mpp in this experiment?
```

**Q5:** Observe the steady state concentration of Mpp if the Mpp is in "OFF" state.<br>

```
Set initial concentration of MAPKK to 50, Mpp to 150 and M to 350, and then bring the model to a steady state. Call this experiment_off.
```

```
What is the steady state concentration of Mpp in this experiment?
```


**Q6:** Evaluate the effect of MAPKK concentration on the steady state concentration of Mpp<br>

```
How will the concentration of Mpp change, if the initial value of MAPKK were to be changed between 1 and 100 in steps of 10?
```
