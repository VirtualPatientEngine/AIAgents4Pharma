**Model** [BIOMD0000000027](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/BIOMD0000000027)


<hr>

### General questions about the model

<hr>

**Q1** Describe the model
```Briefly describe the BioModel 27```


**Q2** Describe model components in natural language
``` Describe the model components ``

<hr>

### Model simulation

**Q3** Ask when does the model reach steady state
``` When does the model reach steady state? ```

**Q4** What is the concentration of Mpp (the readout of the system) at steady state?
``` What is the concentration of Mpp at steady state? ```

**Q5** Simulate the model
``` Simulate this model for 1000 seconds ``


<hr>

### Emergent model behavior (hysteresis)

**Q6** Observe the steady state concentration of Mpp if the Mpp is in "ON" state.
``` Set initial concentration of MAPKK to 50, Mpp to 350 and M to 150.Observe the steady state concentration of Mpp.```


**Q7** Observe the steady state concentration of Mpp if the Mpp is in "OFF" state.
``` Set initial concentration of MAPKK to 50, Mpp to 150 and M to 350.Observe the steady state concentration of Mpp.```

**Q7** Analyze why these values are different and what does this mean.
``` Why are the previous two steady state values of Mpp different? What does this mean? ```
