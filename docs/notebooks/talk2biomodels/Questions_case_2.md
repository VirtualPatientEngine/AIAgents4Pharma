**Model:** [BIOMD0000000971]([text](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/BIOMD0000000971))

<hr>

### General questions about the model

<hr>

**Q1** Describe the model <br>
```Briefly describe the BioModel 971```


**Q2** Describe model components <br>
``` Describe model components```

<hr>

### Model simulation
**Q3** Simulate the model and plot infected cases over time <br>
``` Simulate the model and plot infected cases over time with 50 intervals for 50 days.```


**Q4** Set the quarantine rate rate (q_lockdown) 20 times the initial value (=3.7774 e-06) and simulate the model. (reproduce  figure 3C from the paper) <br>
``` Set the quarantine rate rate 'q_lockdown' to 3.7774e-06 and simulate the model. Plot the infected cases over time.```
