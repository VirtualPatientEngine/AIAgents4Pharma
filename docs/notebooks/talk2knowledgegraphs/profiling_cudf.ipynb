       "  {'desc': 'JAK2 belongs to gene/protein node. JAK2 is Janus kinase 2. This gene encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a central role in cytokine and growth factor signalling. The primary isoform of this protein has an N-terminal FERM domain that is required for erythropoietin receptor association, an SH2 domain that binds STAT transcription factors, a pseudokinase domain and a C-terminal tyrosine kinase domain. Cytokine binding induces autophosphorylation and activation of this kinase. This kinase then recruits and phosphorylates signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. Growth factors like TGF-beta 1 also induce phosphorylation and activation of this kinase and translocation of downstream STAT proteins to the nucleus where they influence gene transcription. Mutations in this gene are associated with numerous inflammatory diseases and malignancies. This gene is a downstream target of the pleiotropic cytokine IL6 that is produced by B cells, T cells, dendritic cells and macrophages to produce an immune response or inflammation. Disregulation of the IL6/JAK2/STAT3 signalling pathways produces increased cellular proliferation and myeloproliferative neoplasms of hematopoietic stem cells. A nonsynonymous mutation in the pseudokinase domain of this gene disrupts the domains inhibitory effect and results in constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation activity and hypersensitivity to cytokine signalling. This gene and the IL6/JAK2/STAT3 signalling pathway is a therapeutic target for the treatment of excessive inflammatory responses to viral infections. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2020].',\n",

      "Elacridar_(18394),\"Elacridar belongs to drug node. Elacridar (GW120918) is an oral bioenhancer that targets multiple drug resistance in tumors. In many cases, the appearance of multidrug resistance in cancer is due to a change in expression of protein inhibitors. As of August 2007 elacridar was not listed on GSK's product pipeline. Development is assumed to have been discontinued. P-glycoprotein is a well characterized human ABC-transporter of the MDR/TAP subfamily. It is an ATP-dependent efflux pump with broad substrate specificity. It likely evolved as a defence mechanism against harmful substances. Increased intestinal expression of P-glycoprotein can reduce the absorption of drugs that are substrates for P-glycoprotein. Thus, there is a reduced bioavailability, therapeutic plasma concentrations are not attained. Elacridar functions by inhibiting P-glycoprotein, resulting in an increased bioavailability of coadminstered drugs.  Elacridar is an oral bioenhancer that targets multiple drug resistance in tumors. In many cases, the appearance of multidrug resistance in cancer is due to a change in expression of protein inhibitors. For the treatment of solid tumors.\"\n",
      "Zosuquidar_(18396),\"Zosuquidar belongs to drug node. Zosuquidar is a compound of antineoplastic drug candidates currently under development. It is now in \\Phase 3\\\"\" of clinical tests in the United States. Its action mechanism consists of the inhibition of P-glycoproteins; other drugs with this mechanism include tariquidar and laniquidar.\"\" P-glycoproteins are proteins which convert the energy derived from the hydrolysis of ATP to structural changes in protein molecules, in order to perform coupling, thus discharging medicine from cells. If P-glycoprotein coded with the MDR1 gene manifests itself in cancer cells, it discharges much of the antineoplastic drugs from the cells, making cancer cells medicine tolerant, and rendering antineoplastic drugs ineffective. This protein also manifests itself in normal organs not affected by the cancer (such as the liver, small intestine, and skin cells in blood vessels of the brain), and participates in the transportation of medicine. The compound Zosuquidar inhibits this P-glycoprotein, causing the cancer cells to lose their medicine tolerance, and making antineoplastic drugs effective.   Investigated for use/treatment in leukemia (myeloid) and myelodysplastic syndrome.\"\n",

      "Cefdinir_(18574),\"Cefdinir belongs to drug node. Cefdinir, also known as Omnicef, is a semi-synthetic, broad-spectrum antibiotic belonging to the third generation of the cephalosporin class. It has been proven to be effective for the treatment of common bacterial infections in the ear, sinus, throat, lungs, and skin. Cefdinir was approved by the FDA in 1997 to treat a variety of mild to moderate infections and was initially marketed by Abbvie. Because of its chemical structure, it is effective against organisms that are resistant to first-line cephalosporin therapy due to the production of beta-lactamase enzymes. Five-member thiazolidine rings that make up penicillins are replaced in cephalosporins by a six-member dihydrothiazine ring, conferring greater bactericidal activity. This This 6-member ring enables cefdinir and other cephalosporins to resist inactivation by certain bacterial enzymes. The plasma protein binding of cefdinir ranges from 60% to approximately 70%. Cefdinir is a bactericidal agent that treats bacterial infections by interfering with cell wall synthesis. Cefdinir is indicated to treat acute bacterial otitis media, acute maxillary sinusitis, community-acquired (CA) pneumonia, acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, and uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections in children and adults.\"\n",
      "Hyaluronic acid_(18583),\"Hyaluronic acid belongs to drug node. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is an anionic, nonsulfated glycosaminoglycan distributed widely throughout connective, epithelial, and neural tissues. It is unique among glycosaminoglycans in that it is nonsulfated, forms in the plasma membrane instead of the Golgi, and can be very large, with its molecular weight often reaching the millions. One of the chief components of the extracellular matrix, hyaluronic acid contributes significantly to cell proliferation and migration, and may also be involved in the progression of some maligt tumors. Hyaluronic acid performs its activities as a tissue lubricant and hence, it is thought to be key in the modulation of interactions between adjacent tissues. Hyaluronic acid is a polysaccharide which is distributed widely in the extracellular matrix of connective tissue in man. It forms a viscoelastic solution in water which makes it suitable for aqueous and vitreous humor in ophthalmic surgery. It is suggested to provide mechanical protection for ocular tissues and cell layers due to its high viscosity. The elasticity of the solutions of hyaluronic acid can assist in the absorption of mechanical stress and the generation of a protective buffer for the tissues. This viscoelasticity enables maintece of a deep chamber during surgical manipulation since the solution does not flow out of the open anterior chamber.   Hyaluronic acid is similar to a substance that occurs naturally in the joints. It may work by acting as a lubricant and shock absorber in the joint, helping the knee to move smoothly, thereby lessening pain. Used to treat knee pain in patients with joint inflammation (osteoarthritis). It is usually used in patients who have not responded to other treatments such as acetaminophen, exercise, or physical therapy. Hyaluronic acid may also be used in plastic surgery to reduce wrinkles on the face or as a filler in other parts of the body. May be used in ophthalmology to assist in the extraction of cataracts, the implantation of intraocular lenses, corneal transplants, glaucoma filtration, retinal attachment and in the treatment of dry eyes. Finally, hyaluronic acid is also used to coat the bladder lining in treating interstitial cystitis.\"\n",

      "Probenecid_(14283),\"Probenecid belongs to drug node. The prototypical uricosuric agent. It inhibits the renal excretion of organic anions and reduces tubular reabsorption of urate. Probenecid has also been used to treat patients with renal impairment, and, because it reduces the renal tubular excretion of other drugs, has been used as an adjunct to antibacterial therapy. Probenecid inhibits the tubular reabsorption of urate, thus increasing the urinary excretion of uric acid and decreasing serum urate levels. Probenecid may also reduce plasma binding of urate and inhibit renal secretion of uric acid at subtherapeutic concentrations. The mechanism by which probenecid inhibits renal tubular transport is not known, but the drug may inhibit transport enzymes that require a source of high energy phosphate bonds and/or nonspecifically interfere with substrate access to protein receptor sites on the kidney tubules. 75-95% Probenecid is a uricosuric and renal tubular blocking agent and is used in combination with colchicine to treat chronic gouty arthritis when complicated by frequent, recurrent acute attacks of gout. It inhibits the reabsorption of urate at the proximal convoluted tubule, thus increasing the urinary excretion of uric acid and decreasing serum urate levels. Effective uricosuria reduces the miscible urate pool, retards urate deposition, and promotes resorption of urate deposits. At the proximal and distal tubles, probenecid competitively inhibits the secretion of many weak organic acids including penicillins, most cephalosporins, and some other β-lactam antibiotics. This results in an increase in the plasma concentrations of acidic drugs eliminated principally by renal secretion, but only a slight increase if the drug is eliminated mainly by filtration. Thus, the drug can be used for therapeutic advantages to increase concentrations of certain β-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of gonorrhea, neurosyphilis, or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). For the reduction of serum uric acid concentrations in chronic gouty arthritis and tophaceous gout in patients with frequent disabling gout attacks. Has also been effectively used to promote uric acid excretion in hyperuricemia secondary to the administration of thiazide and related diuretics. \"\n",
      "Fenofibrate_(14284),\"Fenofibrate belongs to drug node. Fenofibrate is a fibric acid derivative like and. Fenofibrate is used to treat primary hypercholesterolemia, mixed dyslipidemia, severe hypertriglyceridemia. Fenofibrate activates peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARα), increasing lipolysis, activating lipoprotein lipase, and reducing apoprotein C-III. PPARα is a nuclear receptor and its activation alters lipid, glucose, and amino acid homeostasis. Activation of PPARα activates transcription of gene transcription and translation that generates peroxisomes filled with hydrogen peroxide, reactive oxygen species, and hydroxyl radicals that also participate in lipolysis. This mechanism of increased lipid metabolism is also associated with increased oxidative stress on the liver. In rare cases this stress can lead to cirrhosis and chronic active hepatitis. Fenofibrate is 99% protein bound in serum, primarily to albumin. Fenofibrate is a fibrate that activates peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARα) to alter lipid metabolism and treat primary hypercholesterolemia, mixed dyslipidemia, and severe hypertriglyceridemia. Fenofibrate requires once daily dosing and has a half life of 19-27 hours so its duration of action is long. Fenofibrate capsules are given at a dose of 50-150mg daily so the therapeutic index is wide. Patients should be counselled about the risk of rhabdomyolysis, myopathy, and cholelithiasis when taking fibrates. Fenofibrate is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to reduce elevated LDL-C, Total-C, Triglycerides, and Apo B, and to increase HDL-C adults with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia. Fenofibrate is also indicated to treat adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia.\"\n",
      "Rifampicin_(14286),\"Rifampicin belongs to drug node. A semisynthetic antibiotic produced from Streptomyces mediterranei. It has a broad antibacterial spectrum, including activity against several forms of Mycobacterium. In susceptible organisms it inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity by forming a stable complex with the enzyme. It thus suppresses the initiation of RNA synthesis. Rifampin is bactericidal, and acts on both intracellular and extracellular organisms. (From Gilman et al., Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 9th ed, p1160) Rifampin acts via the inhibition of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, leading to a suppression of RNA synthesis and cell death. 89% Rifampin is an antibiotic that inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity in susceptible cells. Specifically, it interacts with bacterial RNA polymerase but does not inhibit the mammalian enzyme. It is bactericidal and has a very broad spectrum of activity against most gram-positive and gram-negative organisms (including <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>) and specifically <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. Because of rapid emergence of resistant bacteria, use is restricted to treatment of mycobacterial infections and a few other indications. Rifampin is well absorbed when taken orally and is distributed widely in body tissues and fluids, including the CSF. It is metabolized in the liver and eliminated in bile and, to a much lesser extent, in urine, but dose adjustments are unnecessary with renal insufficiency. For the treatment of Tuberculosis and Tuberculosis-related mycobacterial infections.\"\n",
      "Ibuprofen_(14287),\"Ibuprofen belongs to drug node. Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) derived from propionic acid and it is considered the first of the propionics. The formula of ibuprofen is 2-(4-isobutylphenyl) propionic acid and its initial development was in 1960 while researching for a safer alternative for aspirin. Ibuprofen was finally patented in 1961 and this drug was first launched against rheumatoid arthritis in the UK in 1969 and USA in 1974. It was the first available over-the-counter NSAID. The exact mechanism of action of ibuprofen is unknown. However, ibuprofen is considered an NSAID and thus it is a non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, which is an enzyme involved in prostaglandin (mediators of pain and fever) and thromboxane (stimulators of blood clotting) synthesis via the arachidonic acid pathway. Ibuprofen dosage is more than 99% bound to plasma proteins and site II of purified albumin, binding appears to be saturable and becomes non-linear at concentrations exceeding 20 mcg/ml. Ibuprofen has multiple actions in different inflammatory pathways involved in acute and chronic inflammation. The main effects reported in ibuprofen are related to the control of pain, fever and acute inflammation by the inhibition of the synthesis of prostanoids by COX-1 and COX-2. Pain relief is attributed to peripheral affected regions and central nervous system effects in the pain transmission mediated by the dorsal horn and higher spinothalamic tract. Some reports have tried to link the pain regulation with a possible enhancement on the synthesis of endogenous cannabinoids and action on the NMDA receptors. The effect on pain has been shown to be related to the cortically evoked potentials. Ibuprofen is the most commonly used and prescribed NSAID. It is very common over the counter medication widely used as an analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic.\"\n",
      "Benzylpenicillin_(14288),\"Benzylpenicillin belongs to drug node. Benzylpenicillin (Penicillin G) is narrow spectrum antibiotic used to treat infections caused by susceptible bacteria. It is a natural penicillin antibiotic that is administered intravenously or intramuscularly due to poor oral absorption. Penicillin G may also be used in some cases as prophylaxis against susceptible organisms. By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, penicillin G inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that penicillin G interferes with an autolysin inhibitor. Bind to serum proteins (45-68%), mainly albumin. Penicillin G is a penicillin beta-lactam antibiotic used in the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible, usually gram-positive, organisms. The name \\penicillin\\\"\" can either refer to several variants of penicillin available, or to the group of antibiotics derived from the penicillins. Penicillin G has <i>in vitro</i> activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The bactericidal activity of penicillin G results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through penicillin G binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). Penicillin G is stable against hydrolysis by a variety of beta-lactamases, including penicillinases, and cephalosporinases and extended spectrum beta-lactamases.\"\" For use in the treatment of severe infections caused by penicillin G-susceptible microorganisms when rapid and high penicillin levels are required such as in the treatment of septicemia, meningitis, pericarditis, endocarditis and severe pneumonia.\"\n",

Glipizide is an oral hypoglycemic agent in the second-generation sulfonylurea drug class that is used to control blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It was first introduced in 1984 and is available in various countries including Canada and the U.S. According to the 2018 Clinical Practice Guidelines by Diabetes Canada, sulfonylurea drugs are considered a second-line glucose-lowering therapy following metformin. Because sulfonylureas require functional pancreatic beta cells for their therapeutic effectiveness, sulfonylureas are more commonly used for early-stage type 2 diabetes when there is no progressed pancreatic failure. Compared to the first-generation sulfonylureas, such as and , second-generation sulfonylureas contain a more non-polar side chain in their chemical structure, which enhances their hypoglycemic potency. Compared to other members of the sulfonylurea drug group, glipizide displays rapid absorption and onset of action with the shortest half-life and duration of action, reducing the risk for long-lasting hypoglycemia that is often observed with blood glucose-lowering agents. Glipizide was first approved by the FDA in 1994 and is available in extended-release tablets under the brand name Glucotrol®, as well as in combination with metformin under the brand name Metaglip®. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder with increasing prevalence worldwide. Characterized by higher-than-normal levels of blood glucose, T2DM is a complex disorder that arises from the interaction between genetic, environmental and behavioral risk factors. Insulin is a peptide hormone that plays a critical role in regulating blood glucose levels. In response to high blood glucose levels, insulin promotes the uptake of glucose into the liver, muscle cells, and fat cells for storage. Although there are multiple events occurring that lead to the pathophysiology of T2DM, the disorder mainly involves insulin insensitivity as a result of insulin resistance, declining insulin production, and eventual failure of beta cells of pancreatic islets that normally produce insulin. Early management with lifestyle intervention, such as controlled diet and exercise, is critical in reducing the risk of long-term secondary complications, such as cardiovascular mortality. Glipizide is about 98-99% bound to serum proteins, with albumin being the main plasma protein. Glipizide is a blood glucose-lowering agent. The initial onset of blood glucose-lowering effect occurs around 30 minutes post-administration with the duration of action lasting for about 12 to 24 hours. While the chronic use of glipizide does not result in elevations in the fasting insulin levels over time, the postprandial insulin response, or insulin response to a meal, is observed to be enhanced, even after 6 months of treatment. The main therapeutic actions of glipizide primarily occur at the pancreas where the insulin release is stimulated, but glipizide also mediates some extrapancreatic effects, such as the promotion of insulin signaling effects on the muscles, fat, or liver cells. Due to its action on the endogenous cells, sulfonylureas including glipizide is associated with a risk for developing hypoglycemia and weight gain in patients receiving the drug. Chronic administration of glipizide may result in down-regulation of the sulfonylurea receptors on pancreatic beta cells, which are molecular targets of the drug, leading to a reduced effect on insulin secretion.  Indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. \"\n",
      "Promethazine_(14295),\"Promethazine belongs to drug node. Promethazine, originally known as 3,277 R.P., is an N-dimethylaminopropyl derivative of that was developed in France in 1946. Promethazine antagonizes a variety of receptors, allowing it to be used for a number of indications including allergic reactions, pain, sedation, nausea, and vomiting. Promethazine is a an antagonist of histamine H1, post-synaptic mesolimbic dopamine, alpha adrenergic, muscarinic, and NMDA receptors. The antihistamine action is used to treat allergic reactions. Antagonism of muscarinic and NMDA receptors contribute to its use as a sleep aid, as well as for anxiety and tension. Antagonism of histamine H1, muscarinic, and dopamine receptors in the medullary vomiting center make promethazine useful in the treatment of nausea and vomiting. Promethazine is 93% protein bound in serum, mostly to albumin. Promethazine is is a histamine H1 antagonist that can be used for it's ability to induce sedation, reduce pain, and treat allergic reactions. Promethazine's effects generally last 4-6h but can last up to 12h. Patients should be counselled regarding CNS and respiratory depression, reduce seizure threshold, and bone marrow depression. Promethazine tablets and suppositories are indicated to treat rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, allergic reactions to blood or plasma, dermographism, anaphylactic reactions, sedation, nausea, vomiting, pain, motion sickness, and allergic skin reactions. Promethazine cough syrup with phenylephrine and codeine is indicated to relieve cough and upper respiratory symptoms, and nasal congestion associated with allergy or the common cold.\"\n",
      "Atazanavir_(14296),\"Atazanavir belongs to drug node. Atazanavir (formerly known as BMS-232632) is an antiretroviral drug of the protease inhibitor (PI) class. Like other antiretrovirals, it is used to treat infection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Atazanavir is distinguished from other PIs in that it can be given once-daily (rather than requiring multiple doses per day) and has lesser effects on the patient's lipid profile (the amounts of cholesterol and other fatty substances in the blood). Like other protease inhibitors, it is used only in combination with other HIV medications. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved atazanavir on June 20, 2003. Atazanavir selectively inhibits the virus-specific processing of viral Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins in HIV-1 infected cells by binding to the active site of HIV-1 protease, thus preventing the formation of mature virions. Atazanavir is not active against HIV-2. 86% bound to human serum proteins (alpha-1-acid glycoprotein and albumin). Protein binding is independent of concentration. Atazanavir (ATV) is an azapeptide HIV-1 protease inhibitor (PI) with activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). HIV-1 protease is an enzyme required for the proteolytic cleavage of the viral polyprotein precursors into the individual functional proteins found in infectious HIV-1. Atazanavir binds to the protease active site and inhibits the activity of the enzyme. This inhibition prevents cleavage of the viral polyproteins resulting in the formation of immature non-infectious viral particles. Protease inhibitors are almost always used in combination with at least two other anti-HIV drugs. Atazanivir is pharmacologically related but structurally different from other protease inhibitors and other currently available antiretrovirals. Used in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, as well as postexposure prophylaxis of HIV infection in individuals who have had occupational or nonoccupational exposure to potentially infectious body fluids of a person known to be infected with HIV when that exposure represents a substantial risk for HIV transmission.\"\n",
      "Atorvastatin_(14297),\"Atorvastatin belongs to drug node. Atorvastatin (Lipitor®), is a lipid-lowering drug included in the statin class of medications. By inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver, statins lower abnormal cholesterol and lipid levels, and ultimately reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid. This conversion is a critical metabolic reaction involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport, including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as \\bad cholesterol\\\"\"), and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing statins is considered standard practice for patients following any cardiovascular event, and for people who are at moderate to high risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The evidence supporting statin use, coupled with minimal side effects and long term benefits, has resulted in wide use of this medication in North America.\"\" Atorvastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Atorvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Atorvastatin also reduces Very-Low-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol (VLDL-C), serum triglycerides (TG) and Intermediate Density Lipoproteins (IDL), as well as the number of apolipoprotein B (apo B) containing particles, but increases High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C).  Atorvastatin is highly bound to plasma proteins and over 98% of the administered dose is found in a bound form. Atorvastatin is an oral antilipemic agent that reversibly inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. It lowers total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apo B), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease, and high ratios are associated with a higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, atorvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.  Atorvastatin is indicated for the treatment of several types of dyslipidemias, including primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia in adults, hypertriglyceridemia, primary dysbetalipoproteinemia, homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in adolescent patients with failed dietary modifications.\"\n",
      "Sertraline_(14299),\"Sertraline belongs to drug node. Sertraline is a popular antidepressant medication commonly known as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and is similar to drugs such as and. Despite marked structural differences between compounds in this drug class, SSRIs exert similar pharmacological effects. Sertraline selectively inhibits the reuptake of serotonin (5-HT) at the presynaptic neuronal membrane, thereby increasing serotonergic activity. This results in an increased synaptic concentration of serotonin in the CNS, which leads to numerous functional changes associated with enhanced serotonergic neurotransmission. These changes are believed to be responsible for the antidepressant action and beneficial effects in obsessive-compulsive (and other anxiety related disorders). It has been hypothesized that obsessive-compulsive disorder, like depression, is also caused by the disregulation of serotonin. Sertraline is highly bound to serum proteins, at about 98%-99%. Sertraline improves or relieves the symptoms of depression, OCD, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder via the inhibition of serotonin reuptake. Clinical studies have shown that it improves cognition in depressed patients. It has less sedative, anticholinergic, and cardiovascular effects than the tricyclic antidepressant drugs because it does not exert significant anticholinergic, antihistamine, or adrenergic (alpha1, alpha2, beta) blocking activity. The onset of action and beneficial effects are usually noticed after 4-6 weeks, for reasons that are not fully understood and currently under investigation. Sertraline is indicated for the management of major depressive disorder (MDD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder (PD), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), and social anxiety disorder (SAD). Common off-label uses for sertraline include the prevention of post stroke depression, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), fibromyalgia, premature ejaculation, migraine prophylaxis, diabetic neuropathy, and neurocardiogenic syncope.\"\n",
      "Miconazole_(14300),\"Miconazole belongs to drug node. Miconazole is a broad-spectrum azole antifungal with some activity against Gram-positive bacteria as well. It is widely used to treat mucosal yeast infections, including both oral and vaginal infections; although intravenous miconazole is no longer available, a wide variety of suppositories, creams, gels, and tablet-based products are available. Miconazole is thought to act primarily through the inhibition of fungal CYP450 14α-lanosterol demethylase activity. Miconazole is an azole antifungal used to treat a variety of conditions, including those caused by _Candida_ overgrowth. Unique among the azoles, miconazole is thought to act through three main mechanisms. The primary mechanism of action is through inhibition of the CYP450 14α-lanosterol demethylase enzyme, which results in altered ergosterol production and impaired cell membrane composition and permeability, which in turn leads to cation, phosphate, and low molecular weight protein leakage. _In vitro_ data suggests that miconazole binds human serum albumin, however, the clinical significance of this observation is unclear. Miconazole is an azole antifungal that functions primarily through inhibition of a specific demethylase within the CYP450 complex. As miconazole is typically applied topically and is minimally absorbed into the systemic circulation following application, the majority of patient reactions are limited to hypersensitivity and cases of anaphylaxis. Patients using intravaginal miconazole products are advised not to rely on contraceptives to prevent pregcy and sexually transmitted infections, as well as not to use tampons concurrently. Miconazole is indicated for the local treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis in adult patients and for the adjunctive treatment of diaper dermatitis complicated by candidiasis in immunocompetent patients aged four weeks and older. Miconazole is available as both a suppository and cream for the treatment of vaginal yeast infections and the relief of associated vulvar itching and irritation. Lastly, miconazole cream is effective in treating athlete's foot (tinea pedis), jock itch (tinea cruris), ringworm infections (tinea corporis), pityriasis (formerly tinea) versicolor, and cutaneous candidiasis.\"\n",
      "Nifedipine_(14301),\"Nifedipine belongs to drug node. Nifedipine, or BAY a 1040, is a first generation dihydropyridine L-type calcium channel blocker, similar to. Nifedipine was developed by Bayer and first described in the literature, along with other dihydropyridines, in 1972. Since nifedipine's development, second and third generation dihydropyridines have been developed with slower onsets and longer durations of action. The most popular of the third generation dihydropyridines is. Nifedipine blocks voltage gated L-type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle and myocardial cells. This blockage prevents the entry of calcium ions into cells during depolarization, reducing peripheral arterial vascular resistance and dilating coronary arteries. These actions reduce blood pressure and increase the supply of oxygen to the heart, alleviating angina. Nifedipine is 92-98% protein bound in serum. Nifedipine is 97±12% bound in a 40g/L solution of pure albumin. Nifedipine is 51.4±5.9% protein bound in a 50mg/100mL solution of alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, and 75.5±3.5% protein bound in a 150mg/mL solution. Nifedipine is an inhibitor of L-type voltage gated calcium channels that reduces blood pressure and increases oxygen supply to the heart. Immediate release nifedipine's duration of action requires dosing 3 times daily. Nifedipine dosing is generally 10-120mg daily. Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of excessive hypotension, angina, and myocardial infarction. Nifedipine capsules are indicated to treat vasospastic angina and chronic stable angina. Extended release tablets are indicated to treat vasospastic angina, chronic stable angina, and hypertension.\"\n",
      "Amiodarone_(14302),\"Amiodarone belongs to drug node. Amiodarone is a benzofuran derivative, anti-arrhythmic drug used commonly in a variety of settings. Most known for its approved indication in life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, it is also used off-label in the outpatient and inpatient setting for atrial fibrillation. Because of its ability to cause serious toxicity and possibly death, amiodarone use should be reserved for its approved indications, according to prescribing information. Amiodarone is considered a class III anti-arrhythmic drug. It blocks potassium currents that cause repolarization of the heart muscle during the third phase of the cardiac action potential. As a result amiodarone increases the duration of the action potential as well as the effective refractory period for cardiac cells (myocytes). Therefore, cardiac muscle cell excitability is reduced, preventing and treating abnormal heart rhythms. The protein binding of amiodarone is about 96%. After intravenous administration, amiodarone acts to relax smooth muscles that line vascular walls, decreases peripheral vascular resistance (afterload), and increases the cardiac index by a small amount. Administration by this route also decreases cardiac conduction, preventing and treating arrhythmias. When it is given orally, however, amiodarone does not lead to significant changes in the left ventricular ejection fraction. Similar to other anti-arrhythmic agents, controlled clinical trials do not confirm that oral amiodarone increases survival.  The FDA approved indications for amiodarone are recurrent ventricular fibrillation (VF)\"\n",
      "Pioglitazone_(14306),\"Pioglitazone belongs to drug node. Pioglitazone is an antihyperglycemic used as an adjunct to diet, exercise, and other antidiabetic medications to manage type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is administered as a racemic mixture, though there is no pharmacologic difference between the etiomers and they appear to interconvert _in vivo_ with little consequence. The thiazolidinedione class of medications, which also includes and , exerts its pharmacological effect primarily by promoting insulin sensitivity and the improved uptake of blood glucose via agonism at the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ). PPARs are ligand-activated transcription factors that are involved in the expression of more than 100 genes and affect numerous metabolic processes, most notably lipid and glucose homeostasis. Pioglitazone is a selective agonist at peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) in target tissues for insulin action such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. Activation of PPARγ increases the transcription of insulin-responsive genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid production, transport, and utilization. Through this mechanism, pioglitazone both enhances tissue sensitivity to insulin and reduces the hepatic production of glucose (i.e. gluconeogenesis) - insulin resistance associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus is therefore improved without an increase in insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells. Pioglitazone is >99% protein-bound in human plasma - binding is primarily to albumin, although pioglitazone has been shown to bind other serum proteins with a lower affinity. The M-III and M-IV metabolites of pioglitazone are >98% protein-bound (also primarily to albumin). Pioglitazone enhances cellular responsiveness to insulin, increases insulin-dependent glucose disposal, and improves impaired glucose homeostasis. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, these effects result in lower plasma glucose concentrations, lower plasma insulin concentrations, and lower HbA1c values. Pioglitazone is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is also available in combination with , , or for the same indication.\"\n",
      "Carvedilol_(14308),\"Carvedilol belongs to drug node. Carvedilol is a racemic mixture where the S(-) etiomer is a beta adrenoceptor blocker and the R(+) etiomer is both a beta and alpha-1 adrenoceptor blocker. It is currently used to treat heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, and hypertension. The dual action of carvedilol is advantageous in combination therapies as moderate doses of 2 drugs have a decreased incidence of adverse effects compared to high dose monotherapy in the treatment of moderate hypertension. Carvedilol inhibits exercise induce tachycardia through its inhibition of beta adrenoceptors. Carvedilol's action on alpha-1 adrenergic receptors relaxes smooth muscle in vasculature, leading to reduced peripheral vascular resistance and an overall reduction in blood pressure. At higher doses, calcium channel blocking and antioxidant activity can also be seen. The antioxidant activity of carvedilol prevents oxidation of low density lipoprotein and its uptake into coronary circulation. Carvedilol is 98% protein bound in plasma. 95% of carvedilol is bound to serum albumin. Carvedilol reduces tachycardia through beta adrenergic antagonism and lowers blood pressure through alpha-1 adrenergic antagonism. It has a long duration of action as it is generally taken once daily and has a broad therapeutic index as patients generally take 10-80mg daily. Patients taking carvedilol should not abruptly stop taking this medication as this may exacerbate coronary artery disease. Carvedilol is indicated to treat mild to severe heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction with ventricular ejection fraction ≤40%, or hypertension.\"\n",
      "Levofloxacin_(14309),\"Levofloxacin belongs to drug node. Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic and the optical S-(-) isomer of racemic. It reportedly carries 8 to 128-fold more activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria compared to R-(+)-ofloxacin and remains stereochemically stable following administration (i.e. it does not invert to the inactive isomer). Levofloxacin, along with other quinolones such as and , is a member of the third generation of fluoroquinolones, colloquially referred to as the \\respiratory quinolones\\\"\" due to improved activity against gram-positive bacteria commonly implicated in respiratory infections.\"\" Levofloxacin, like other fluoroquinolone antibiotics, exerts its antimicrobial activity via the inhibition of two key bacterial enzymes: DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Both targets are type II topoisomerases, but have unique functions within the bacterial cell. DNA gyrase is an enzyme found only in bacteria that introduces negative supercoils into DNA during replication - this helps to relieve torsional strain caused by the introduction of positive supercoils during replication, and these negative supercoils are essential for chromosome condensation and the promotion of transcription initiation. It is comprised of four subunits (two A subunits and two B subunits) of which the A subunits appear to be the target of fluoroquinolone antibiotics. Bacterial topoisomerase IV, in addition to contributing to the relaxation of positive supercoils, is essential at the terminal stages of DNA replication and functions to “unlink” newly replicated chromosomes to allow for the completion of cell division. Levofloxacin is 24-38% protein-bound in plasma, primarily to albumin. The extent of protein-binding is independent of its plasma concentration. Levofloxacin is bactericidal and exerts its antimicrobial effects via inhibition of bacterial DNA replication. It has a relatively long duration of action in comparison with other antibiotics that allows for once or twice daily dosing. Levofloxacin is associated with QTc-interval prolongation and should be used with caution in patients with other risk factors for prolongation (e.g. hypokalemia, concomitant medications). In oral and intravenous formulations, levofloxacin is indicated in adults for the treatment of various infections caused by susceptible bacteria, including infections of the upper respiratory tract, lower respiratory tract, skin, skin structures, urinary tract, and prostate. The oral formulation is also indicated in both adults and children 6 months of age and older for the post-exposure management of inhalational anthrax caused by _Bacillus anthracis_ and for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of plague caused by _Yersinia pestis_.\"\n",

      "Aminohippuric acid_(20202),\"Aminohippuric acid belongs to drug node. The glycine amide of 4-aminobenzoic acid. Its sodium salt is used as a diagnostic aid to measure effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) and excretory capacity.  Aminohippurate is filtered by the renal glomeruli and secreted into the urine by the proximal tubules. By measuring the amount of drug in the urine it is possible to determine functional capacity and effective renal plasma flow.  Aminohippurate (p-aminohippuric acid, PAH, PAHA) is the glycine amide of p-aminobenzoic acid. It is filtered by the glomeruli and is actively secreted by the proximal tubules. At low plasma concentrations (1.0 to 2.0 mg/100 mL), an average of 90 percent of aminohippurate is cleared by the kidneys from the renal blood stream in a single circulation. It is ideally suited for measurement of ERPF since it has a high clearance, is essentially nontoxic at the plasma concentrations reached with recommended doses, and its analytical determination is relatively simple and accurate. Aminohippurate is also used to measure the functional capacity of the renal tubular secretory mechanism or transport maximum (Tm<sub>PAH</sub>). This is accomplished by elevating the plasma concentration to levels (40-60 mg/100 mL) sufficient to saturate the maximal capacity of the tubular cells to secrete aminohippurate. Inulin clearance is generally measured during Tm<sub>PAH</sub> determinations since glomerular filtration rate (GFR) must be known before calculations of secretory Tm measurements can be done. Used to measure effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) and to determine the functional capacity of the tubular excretory mechanism.\"\n",

Cefepime is usually reserved to treat severe nosocomial pneumonia, infections caused by multi-resistant microorganisms (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and empirical treatment of febrile neutropenia. Cephalosporins are bactericidal and have the same mode of action as other beta-lactam antibiotics (such as penicillins). Cephalosporins disrupt the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer of bacterial cell walls. The peptidoglycan layer is important for cell wall structural integrity, especially in Gram-positive organisms.

      "Acetylcarnitine_(20211),\"Acetylcarnitine belongs to drug node. Acetylcarnitine is an investigational drug in the United states, Italy, United Kingdom, China, Israel, and Norway, and it is approved in Italy, Portugal, Argentina, Chile, Philippines, Australia, and India. Acetylcarnitine can be synthesized, but it is also naturally found in adequate amounts in healthy humans. In human plasma and tissues, acetylcarnitine is the most predomit acylated ester of carnitine, which is an amino acid derivative that is made in the kidney, liver, and brain from lysine and methionine. The main role of acetylcarnitine is to help transport fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix where fatty acid metabolism occurs. The mechanisms of action of acetylcarnitine have not been fully elucidated, but it seems that the main role of acetylcarnitine is to donate an acetyl group during fatty acid metabolism to help transport fatty acids, such as acetyl CoA, into the mitochondrial matrix where fatty acid metabolism occurs. Additionally several studies have found that separate from its metabolic role, acetylcarnitine has neuromodulatory, neurotrophic, and neuroprotective effects that most likely are involved in its positive effects in neurological diseases. In its role in treating male infertility, acetylcarnitine increases the active movement of sperm cells. One study has also mentioned a role for acetylcarnitine as an antioxidant. The study found that through the receptor, tyrosine kinase A, acetylcarnitine was able to decrease the production of free radicals, peroxidation of lipids, and oxidation of proteins as well as decrease glutathione levels and increase thioredoxin.  The complete physiological effects of acetycarnitine are still being studied. What has been discovered so far is that acetylcarinitine has positive effects on mental fatigue, neurodegenerative disorders, cognitive functions, peripheral neuropathy, and sperm motility. Specifically, in one study involving patients with HIV, patients on acetylcarnitine supplementation had increased CD4 cells, decreased lymphocyte apoptosis, improved polyneuropathy and cardiovascular damage, and decreased triglyceride and TNF alpha levels in the blood. Another study showed that acetylcarnitine increased glucose disposal in type 2 diabetic patients through possibly increasing the activity of glycogen synthase. Acetylcarnitine is not approved for any indication in the United states and Canada, but it is approved and indicated in Italy for cerebrovascular disorders, mental function disorders, peripheral nerve disorders, diabetic neuropathy, and nutritional supplementation; Portugal for mental function disorders; Argentina for cerebral vasculopathy, nutritional supplementation, and peripheral neuropathy; Chile for dementia; Philippines for cerebrovascular disorders and mental function disorders; Australia for nutritional supplementation; and India for nutritional supplementation to increase sperm count. Acetylcarnitine also has several potential therapeutic indications for which it is still being investigated: in Norway, acetylcarnitine is in a phase IV trial for prophylactic treatment of migraines; in Italy acetylcarnitine is in a phase II trial for use in patients with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, a phase III trial for alleviating fatigue in patients with chronic hepatitis C, and for use in patients with Minimal Hepatic Encephalopathy; in the United States acetylcarnitine is in a phase II trial for the neurodegenerative disorder Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, a phase II and III trial for reducing peripheral neuropathy in cancer patients as an adjunct to chemotherapy, a phase I and II trial for treating patients in septic shock, a phase II trial for bipolar depression, a phase II trial to reduce oxidative stress in patients with Sickle Cell disease, a phase I and II trial for chronic fatigue syndrome, and a study for preventing nerve damage in HIV patients; in China acetylcarnitine is in a phase III trial for reducing peripheral neuropathy in cancer patients as an adjunct to chemotherapy; in the United Kingdom acetylcarnitine is being investigated for preventing nerve damage in HIV patients; and in Israel acetylcarnitine is being studied for the treatment of male infertility.\"\n",

Gramcidin D is a heterogeneous mixture of three antibiotic compounds, gramicidins A, B and C, making up 80%, 6%, and 14% respectively all of which are obtained from the soil bacterial species Bacillus brevis and called collectively gramicidin D. Gramcidins are 15 residue peptides with alternating D and L amino acids, which assemble inside of the hydrophobic interior of the cellular lipid bilayer to form a β-helix. Active against most Gram-positive bacteria and some Gram-negative organisms, Gramicidin D is used primarily as a topical antibiotic and is also found in Polysporin ophthalmic solution. Gramicidin D binds to and inserts itself into bacterial membranes (with a strong preference to gram-positive cell membranes). This results in membrane disruption and permeabilization (it acts as a channel). This leads to (i) loss of intracellular solutes (e.g., K+ and amino acids); (ii) dissipation of the transmembrane potential; (iii) inhibition of respiration; (iv) a reduction in ATP pools; and (v) inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, which leads to cell death.  Gramicidin is particularly effective against gram-positive bacteria. Because the drug is highly hemolytic, it cannot be administered internally and so is used only on the skin as a lotion or ointment. It is used primarily in the treatment of infected surface wounds, and in eye, nose, and throat infections. It is normally given with two other antibiotics (neomycin and polymixin B) as an ophthalmic solution. For treatment of skin lesions, surface wounds and eye infections.\"\n",

Linagliptin differs from other DPP-4 inhibitors in that it has a non-linear pharmacokinetic profile, is not primarily eliminated by the renal system, and obeys concentration dependant protein binding. Linagliptin was approved by the FDA on May 2, 2011. Linagliptin is a competitive, reversible DPP-4 inhibitor. Inhibition of this enzyme slows the breakdown of GLP-1 and glucose-dependant insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). GLP-1 and GIP stimulate the release of insulin from beta cells in the pancreas while inhibiting release of glucagon from pancreatic beta cells. These effects together reduce the breakdown of glycogen in the liver and increase insulin release in response to glucose. Linagliptin is 99% protein bound at a concentration of 1nmol/L and 75-89% protein bound at a concentration of >30nmol/L. A 5mg oral dose of linagliptin results in >80% inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) for ≥24 hours. Inhibition of DPP-4 increases the concentration of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), leading to decreased glycosylated hemoglobin and fasting plasma glucose. Linagliptin is indicated for the treatment of type II diabetes in addition to diet and exercise. It should not be used to treat type I diabetes or in diabetic ketoacidosis.

It was developed by Speedel and Novartis and initially approved by the FDA in early 2007. Aliskiren has been proven to efficacious in reducing blood pressure when used alone or in conjunction with other antihypertensive agents. Aliskiren is a renin inhibitor. Renin is secreted by the kidneys when blood volume and renal perfusion decrease. It normally cleaves the protein angiotensinogen to form angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is then converted to angiotensin II, an active protein. Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor that causes the release of catecholamines into the circulation. It also promotes the secretion of aldosterone in addition to sodium reabsorption, increasing blood pressure. Additionally, angiotensin II acts on the adrenal cortex where it stimulates aldosterone release. Aldosterone increases sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion in the nephron.  The plasma protein binding of aliskiren ranges from 47-51%. Aliskiren reduces blood pressure by inhibiting renin. This leads to a cascade of events that decreases blood pressure, lowering the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events including stroke and myocardial infarction. Aliskiren is used for the treatment of hypertension in children above 6 years and adults.

Vorapaxar is a tricyclic himbacine-derived selective inhibitor of protease activated receptor (PAR-1) indicated for reducing the incidence of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) or with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). By inhibiting PAR-1, a thrombin receptor expressed on platelets, vorapaxar prevents thrombin-related platelet aggregation. Vorapaxar inhibits platelet aggregation through the reversible antagonism of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1), also known as thrombin receptor. PARs are a family of G-protein coupled receptors highly expressed on platelets and activated by serine protease activity of thrombin to mediate thrombotic response. By blocking PAR-1 activating, vorapaxar inhibits thrombin-induced platelet aggregation and thrombin receptor agonist peptide (TRAP)-induced platelet aggregation.

Ceritinib is used for the treatment of adults with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following failure (secondary to resistance or intolerance) of prior crizotinib therapy. About 4% of patients with NSCLC have a chromosomal rearrangement that generates a fusion gene between EML4 (echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4) and ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase), which results in constitutive kinase activity that contributes to carcinogenesis and seems to drive the maligt phenotype. Ceritinib exerts its therapeutic effect by inhibiting autophosphorylation of ALK, ALK-mediated phosphorylation of the downstream signaling protein STAT3, and proliferation of ALK-dependent cancer cells. Following treatment with crizotinib (a first-generation ALK inhibitor), most tumours develop drug resistance due to mutations in key \\gatekeeper\\\"\" residues of the enzyme. This occurrence led to development of novel second-generation ALK inhibitors such as ceritinib to overcome crizotinib resistance. The FDA approved ceritinib in April 2014 due to a surprisingly high response rate (56%) towards crizotinib-resistant tumours and has designated it with orphan drug status.\"\" Ceritinib inhibits Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) also known as ALK tyrosine kinase receptor or CD246 (cluster of differentiation 246), which is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the ALK gene. About 4-5% of NSCLCs have a chromosomal rearrangement that generates a fusion gene between EML4 (echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4) and ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase), which results in constitutive kinase activity that contributes to carcinogenesis and seems to drive the maligt phenotype. Ceritinib exerts its therapeutic effect by inhibiting autophosphorylation of ALK, ALK-mediated phosphorylation of the downstream signaling protein STAT3, and proliferation of ALK-dependent cancer cells. Ceritinib has been shown to inhibit in vitro proliferation of cell lines expressing EML4-ALK and NPM-ALK fusion proteins and demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC xenograft growth in mice and rats. Ceritinib is 97% bound to human plasma proteins, independent of drug concentration.  Ceritinib is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed on or are intolerant to crizotinib.

      "Somatostatin_(15618),\"Somatostatin belongs to drug node. Somatostatin, also known as growth hormone-inhibiting hormone, is a naturally-occurring peptide hormone of 14 or 28 amino acid residues that regulates the endocrine system. It is secreted by the D cells of the islets to inhibit the release of insulin and glucagon, and is also generated in the hypothalamus, where it inhibits the release of growth hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormones from the anterior pituitary. Somatostatin is initially secreted as a 116 amino acid precursor, preprosomatostatin, which undergoes endoproteolytic cleavage to prosomastatin. Prosomastatin is further process into two active forms, somatostatin-14 (SST-14) and somatostatin-28 (SST-28), an extended SST-14 sequence to the N-terminus. The actions of somatostatin are mediated via signalling pathways of G protein-coupled somatostatin receptors.  Somatostatin binds to 5 subtypes of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), which are all Gi-protein-coupled transmembrane receptors that inhibits adenylyl cyclase upon activation. By inhibiting intracellular cyclic AMP and Ca2+ and by a receptor-linked distal effect on exocytosis, SSTRs block cell secretion. The common pathway shared by the receptors involve the activation of phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTP), and modulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). With the exception of SSTR3, activation of SSTRs lead to activation of voltage-gated potassium channels accompanied by increased K+ currents. This result in membrane hyperpolarization and inhibits depolarization-induced Ca2+ influx through voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels. Depending on the receptor subtype, signalling cascades involve activation of other downstream targets such as Na+/H+ exchanger, Rho GTPase, and nitric oxide synthase (NOS). SSTRs 1 to 4 bind both somatostatin isoforms with equal omolar binding affinity whereas SSTR5 exhibits a 5- to 10-fold higher binding affinity for SST-28.  This pharmacokinetic data is irrelevant. Somatostatin is an endogenous peptide hormone that is secreted by the central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, retina, peripheral neurons and pancreatic D cells of the islets of Langerhans. It exhibits several biological roles but predomitly exerts an inhibitory effect on secretion of other hormones and transmitters. While distribution of two active isoforms of somatostatin is similar, SST-14 is more predomit in the enteric neurons and peripheral nerves whereas SST-28 is more prominent in the retina and intestinal mucosal cells.

      "Selexipag_(15642),\"Selexipag belongs to drug node. Selexipag was approved by the United States FDA on December 22, 2015 for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) to delay disease progression and reduce risk of hospitalization. PAH is a relatively rare disease with usually a poor prognosis requiring more treatment options to prolong long-term outcomes. Marketed by Actelion Pharmaceuticals under brand name Uptravi, selexipag and its active metabolite, ACT-333679 (MRE-269), act as agonists of the prostacyclin receptor to increase vasodilation in the pulmonary circulation and decrease elevated pressure in the blood vessels supplying blood to the lungs. Selexipag is a selective prostacyclin (IP, also called PGI2) receptor agonist. The key features of pulmonary arterial hypertension include a decrease in prostacyclin and prostacyclin synthase (enzyme that helps produce prostacyclin) in the lung. Prostacyclin is a potent vasodilator with anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-thrombotic effects; therefore, there is strong rationale for treatment with IP receptor agonists. Selexipag is chemically distinct as it is not PGI2 or a PGI2 analogue and has high selectivity for the IP receptor. It is metabolized by carboxylesterase 1 to yield an active metabolite (ACT-333679) that is approximately 37 times more potent than selexipag. Both selexipag and its metabolite are selective for the IP receptor over other prostanoid receptors.  Both selexipag and its active metabolite are highly protein bound, approximately 99%. At the maximum tolerated dose of 1600 mcg twice per day, selexipag was not found to prolong the QT interval to a clinically relevant extent. Both selexipag and its metabolite caused concentration-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation in vitro with IC50 of 5.5 µM and 0.21 µM, respectively. However, at clinically relevant concentrations, there was no effect on platelet aggregation test parameters following multiple dose administration of selexipag in healthy patients.

      "Venetoclax_(15654),\"Venetoclax belongs to drug node. Venetoclax is a BCL-2 inhibitor that was initially approved by the FDA in April 2016. Proteins in the B cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family are important regulators of the apoptotic (programmed cell death) process ,. Venetoclax is used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and certain types of small lymphocytic lymphoma. CLL is the most prevalent leukemia diagnosed in Western countries. Venetoclax was developed through reverse engineering of the BCL-2 protein family inhibitor, navitoclax. Venetoclax is approximately 10 times more potent than navitoclax with regard to induction of apoptosis in CLL cells. A new indication was approved in 2018 for the treatment patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), with or without 17p deletion, who have received at least one prior therapy. Previously, this drug was indicated only for patients with 17p gene deletion. Proteins in the B cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family are necessary regulators of the apoptotic (anti-cell programmed death) process. This family comprises proapoptotic and prosurvival proteins for various cells. Cancer cells evade apoptosis by inhibiting programmed cell death (apoptosis). The therapeutic potential of directly inhibiting prosurvival proteins was unveiled with the development of navitoclax, a selective inhibitor of both BCL-2 and BCL-2-like 1 (BCL-X(L)), which has demonstrated clinical efficacy in some BCL-2-dependent hematological cancers. Selective inhibition of BCL-2 by venetoclax, sparing BCL-xL enables therapeutic induction of apoptosis without the negative effect of thrombocytopenia ,.  Venetoclax helps restore the process of apoptosis by binding directly to the BCL-2 protein, displacing pro-apoptotic proteins, leading to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and the activation of caspase enzymes. In nonclinical studies, venetoclax has shown cytotoxic activity in tumor cells that overexpress BCL-2. Venetoclax is highly bound to human plasma protein with unbound fraction in plasma <0.01 across a concentration range of 1-30 µM (0.87-26 µg/mL). The mean blood-to-plasma ratio was 0.57. Venetoclax induces rapid and potent onset apoptosis of CLL cells, powerful enough to act within 24h and to lead to tumor lysis syndrome , ,. Selective targeting of BCL2 with venetoclax has demonstrated a manageable safety profile and has been shown to induce significant response in patients with relapsed CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) or SLL (small lymphocytic leukemia), including patients with poor prognostic features. This drug is not expected to have a significant impact on the cardiac QT interval. Venetoclax has demonstrated efficacy in various types of lymphoid maligcies, including relapsed/ refractory CLL harboring deletion 17p, with an overall response rate of approximately 80%.

Velpatasvir is a Direct-Acting Antiviral (DAA) medication used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients. Velpatasvir acts as a defective substrate for NS5A (Non-Structural Protein 5A), a non-enzymatic viral protein that plays a key role in Hepatitis C Virus replication, assembly, and modulation of host immune responses. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as velpatasvir. Notably, velpatasvir has a significantly higher barrier to resistance than the first generation NS5A inhibitors, such as and , making it a highly potent and reliable alternative for treatment of chronic Hepatitis C.  Velpatasvir's mechanism of action is likely similar to other selective NS5A inhibitors which bind domain I of NS5A consisting of amino acids 33-202. NS5A inhibitors compete with RNA for binding at this site. It is also thought that NS5A inhibitors bind the target during its action in replication when the binding site is exposed. Inhibition of NS5A is also known to produce redistribution of the protein to lipid droplets. The exact role of NS5A in RNA replication is not yet understood although it is known to be an important component. >99.5% bound to plasma proteins. Velpatasvir is a small molecule direct-acting antiviral used in the treatment of hepatitis C in combination with sofosbuvir.

      "Baricitinib_(15666),\"Baricitinib belongs to drug node. Baricitinib is a selective and reversible Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and 2 (JAK2) inhibitor. Janus kinases belong to the tyrosine protein kinase family and play an important role in the proinflammatory pathway signalling that is frequently over-activated in autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. By blocking the actions of JAK1/2, baricitinib disrupts the activation of downstream signalling molecules and proinflammatory mediators.  JAK enzymes are part of the family of tyrosine kinases that constitutively bind to the intracellular domains of cytokine receptors and promote the signalling cascades of cytokines and growth factors involved in haematopoiesis, inflammation and immune function that are also implicated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. Circulating proinflammatory cytokines bind to these cell surface receptors. Upon binding of extracellular cytokines and growth factors, JAKs are phosphorylated and activate signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Through the signalling cascades, inflammatory cytokine and chemokine transcription is induced to form inflammatory mediators including IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-15, IL-23, IFN-γ and GM-CSF.  Baricitinib is approximately 50 % bound to plasma proteins.   Indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate.\"\n",
      "Apalutamide_(15668),\"Apalutamide belongs to drug node. Apalutamide is a potent androgen receptor (AR) antagonist that selectively binds to the ligand-binding domain of AR and blocks AR nuclear translocation or binding to androgen response elements. It has been used in trials studying the treatment of Prostate Cancer, Hepatic Impairment, Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer, and Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant, among others. Exerting an antitumor action, apalutamide blocking the effect of androgens that promote tumor growth. It targets the AR ligand-binding domain and prevents AR nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and transcription of AR gene targets in prostate tumors. In mice bearing human CRPC xenograft models, apalutamide treatment produced tumor regressions in a dose-dependent manner that was more effective than that of or. Unlike bicalutamide, apalutamide antagonized AR-mediated signaling in AR overexpressing human CRPC cell lines. Persistent androgen receptor (AR) signaling is a common feature of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), attributed to AR gene-amplification, AR gene mutation, increased AR expression or increased androgen biosynthesis in prostate tumors. Apalutamide is an antagonist of AR that to the binding-site in the ligand-binding domain of the receptor with the IC50 of 16 nM. Upon binding, apalutamide disrupts AR signalling, inhibits DNA binding, and impedes AR-mediated gene transcription. Apalutamide impairs the translocation of AR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus thus reduces the concentrations of AR available to interact with the androgen response-elements (AREs). Upon treatment with apalutamide, AR was not recruited to the DNA promoter-regions.  Apalutamide was 96% and N-desmethyl apalutamide was 95% bound to plasma proteins with no concentration dependency. In an open-label, uncontrolled, multi-center, single-arm dedicated QT study in 45 patients with CRPC, an exposure-QT analysis suggested a concentration-dependent increase in QTcF for apalutamide and its active metabolite.

      "Docetaxel_(14793),\"Docetaxel belongs to drug node. Docetaxel is a clinically well established anti-mitotic chemotherapy medication used mainly for the treatment of breast, ovarian, and non-small cell lung cancer. Docetaxel reversibly binds to tubulin with high affinity in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio Docetaxel interferes with the normal function of microtubule growth. Whereas drugs like colchicine cause the depolymerization of microtubules in vivo, docetaxel arrests their function by having the opposite effect; it hyper-stabilizes their structure. This destroys the cell's ability to use its cytoskeleton in a flexible manner. Specifically, docetaxel binds to the &beta;-subunit of tubulin. Tubulin is the \\building block\\\"\" of microtubules, and the binding of docetaxel locks these building blocks in place. The resulting microtubule/docetaxel complex does not have the ability to disassemble. This adversely affects cell function because the shortening and lengthening of microtubules (termed dynamic instability) is necessary for their function as a transportation highway for the cell. Chromosomes, for example, rely upon this property of microtubules during mitosis. Further research has indicated that docetaxel induces programmed cell death (apoptosis) in cancer cells by binding to an apoptosis stopping protein called Bcl-2 (B-cell leukemia 2) and thus arresting its function.\"\" In vitro studies show that 94% protein bound, mainly to a1-acid glycoprotein, albumin, and lipoproteins. When measured in cancer patients, docetaxel is 97% bound to plasma protein. Dexamethasone does not affect the protein binding of docetaxel. Docetaxel is a taxoid antineoplastic agent. It promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilizes microtubules by preventing depolymerization. This stability results in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions. In addition, docetaxel induces abnormal arrays or \\bundles\\\"\" of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis.\"\" For the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy. Also used as a single agent in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after failure of prior platinum-based chemotherapy.

Troglitazone is a thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agent that lowers blood glucose by improving target cell response to insulin. It has a unique mechanism of action that is dependent on the presence of insulin for activity. Troglitazone decreases hepatic glucose output and increases insulin dependent glucose disposal in skeletal muscle. Its mechanism of action is thought to involve binding to nuclear receptors (PPAR) that regulate the transcription of a number of insulin responsive genes critical for the control of glucose and lipid metabolism. Troglitazone is a ligand to both PPARα and PPARγ, with a highter affinity for PPARγ. The drug also contains an α-tocopheroyl moiety, potentially giving it vitamin E-like activity. Troglitazone has been shown to reduce inflammation, and is associated with a decrase in nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) and a concomitant increase in its inhibitor (IκB). Unlike sulfonylureas, troglitazone is not an insulin secretagogue. > 99% (primarily to serum albumin) Troglitazone is an oral antihyperglycemic agent which acts primarily by decreasing insulin resistance.

      "Riboflavin_(14833),\"Riboflavin belongs to drug node. Nutritional factor found in milk, eggs, malted barley, liver, kidney, heart, and leafy vegetables. The richest natural source is yeast. It occurs in the free form only in the retina of the eye, in whey, and in urine; its principal forms in tissues and cells are as flavin mononucleotide and flavin-adenine dinucleotide. Binds to riboflavin hydrogenase, riboflavin kinase, and riboflavin synthase. Riboflavin is the precursor of flavin mononucleotide (FMN, riboflavin monophosphate) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). The antioxidant activity of riboflavin is principally derived from its role as a precursor of FAD and the role of this cofactor in the production of the antioxidant reduced glutathione. Reduced glutathione is the cofactor of the selenium-containing glutathione peroxidases among other things. The glutathione peroxidases are major antioxidant enzymes. Reduced glutathione is generated by the FAD-containing enzyme glutathione reductase. 60% Riboflavin or vitamin B2 is an easily absorbed, water-soluble micronutrient with a key role in maintaining human health. Like the other B vitamins, it supports energy production by aiding in the metabolising of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. Vitamin B2 is also required for red blood cell formation and respiration, antibody production, and for regulating human growth and reproduction.

      "Menadione_(14834),\"Menadione belongs to drug node. A synthetic naphthoquinone without the isoprenoid side chain and biological activity, but can be converted to active vitamin K2, menaquinone, after alkylation in vivo. Menadione (vitamin K3) is involved as a cofactor in the posttranslational gamma-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues of certain proteins in the body. These proteins include the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II (prothrombin), VII (proconvertin), IX (Christmas factor), X (Stuart factor), protein C, protein S, protein Zv and a growth-arrest-specific factor (Gas6). In contrast to the other vitamin K-dependent proteins in the blood coagulation cascade, protein C and protein S serve anticoagulant roles. The two vitamin K-dependent proteins found in bone are osteocalcin, also known as bone G1a (gamma-carboxyglutamate) protein or BGP, and the matrix G1a protein or MGP. Gamma-carboxylation is catalyzed by the vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylases. The reduced form of vitamin K, vitamin K hydroquinone, is the actual cofactor for the gamma-carboxylases. Proteins containing gamma-carboxyglutamate are called G1a proteins.  Menadione (Vitamin K3) is a fat-soluble vitamin precursor that is converted into menaquinone in the liver. Vitamin K1 and K2 are the naturally occurring types of vitamin K. The former, which is also known as phylloquinone, is synthesized by plants and can be found in such foods as spinach, broccoli, lettuce, and soybeans. The latter, sometimes alternatively referred to as menaquinone, is primarily produced by bacteria in the anterior part of the gut and the intestines. Vitamin K3, on the other hand, is one of the many manmade versions of vitamin K. Also called menadione, this yellowish, synthetic crystalline substance is converted into the active form of the K2 vitamin inside of the animal body. While a vitamin K deficiency can be dangerous, especially to infants that may easily suffer from extensive hemorrhaging, an overdose can be as equally detrimental. Newborns that are administered too great a dosage of vitamin K3 can suffer from kernicterus, a form of severe brain damage that may produce decreased movement, loss of appetite, seizures, deafness, mental retardation, and even death. This condition is associated with an abnormally high concentration of bilirubin, a bile pigment, in the tissues of the brain, which can be caused by the presence of K3. For this reason, K3 is less often utilized medically than it was in former times. The primary known function of vitamin K is to assist in the normal clotting of blood, but it may also play a role in normal bone calcification.\"\n",
      "Benazepril_(14835),\"Benazepril belongs to drug node. Benazepril, brand name Lotensin, is a medication used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension), congestive heart failure, and chronic renal failure. Upon cleavage of its ester group by the liver, benazepril is converted into its active form benazeprilat, a non-sulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Benazeprilat, the active metabolite of Benazepril, competes with angiotensin I for binding at the angiotensin-converting enzyme, blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II. As angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor and a negative-feedback mediator for renin activity, lower concentrations result in a decrease in blood pressure and stimulation of baroreceptor reflex mechanisms, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. Benazepril is 96.7% protein bound while benazeprilat is 95.3% protein bound. Benazepril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is a prodrug which, when hydrolyzed by esterases to its active Benazeprilat, is used to treat hypertension and heart failure, to reduce proteinuria and renal disease in patients with nephropathies, and to prevent stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiac death in high-risk patients. Benazepril and Benazeprilat inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Benazepril is indicated for the treatment of hypertension.

It is mainly used for infiltration anesthesia, peripheral nerve block, and spinal block. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p1016). Procaine has also been investigated as an oral entry inhibitor in treatment-experienced HIV patients. Procaine acts mainly by inhibiting sodium influx through voltage gated sodium channels in the neuronal cell membrane of peripheral nerves. When the influx of sodium is interrupted, an action potential cannot arise and signal conduction is thus inhibited. The receptor site is thought to be located at the cytoplasmic (inner) portion of the sodium channel. Procaine has also been shown to bind or antagonize the function of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors as well as nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and the serotonin receptor-ion channel complex.  Procaine is an anesthetic agent indicated for production of local or regional anesthesia, particularly for oral surgery. Procaine (like cocaine) has the advantage of constricting blood vessels which reduces bleeding, unlike other local anesthetics like lidocaine. Procaine is an ester anesthetic.

      "Miltefosine_(14876),\"Miltefosine belongs to drug node. Miltefosine is a broad spectrum antimicrobial, anti-leishmanial, phospholipid drug that was originally developed in the 1980s as an anti-cancer agent. It is currently the only recognized oral agent used to treat visceral, cutaneous, and mucosal forms of leishmaniasis, a neglected tropical disease. It can be administered topically or orally and is only indicated in patients aged 12 years or older. The CDC has also recommended it as a first line treatment for free-living amebae (FLA) infections such as primary amebic meningoencephalitis and granulomatous amebic encephalitis. Miltefosine has demonstrated activity against Leishmania parasites and neoplastic cells primarily due to its effects on apoptosis and disturbance of lipid-dependent cell signalling pathways. Several potential antileishmanial mechanisms of action have been proposed, however no mechanism has been identified definitely. Within the mitochondria, miltefosine inhibits cytochrome-c oxidase leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis-like cell death. Antineoplastic mechanisms of action are related to antileishmanial targets and include inhibition of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis and inhibition of Akt (also known as protein kinase B), which is a crucial protein within the PI3K/Akt/mTOR intracellular signalling pathway involved in regulating the cell cycle. Animal studies also suggest it may be effective against Trypanosome cruzi (the organism responsible for Chagas' disease), metronidazole-resistant strains of Trichonomas vaginalis, and it may have broad-spectrum anti-fungal activity.  Plasma protein binding ranges from 96% to 98%. Miltefosine binds to both serum albumin (97% bound) and low-density lipoprotein (3% bound). Little is known about the clinical pharmacodynamics of miltefosine and other antileishmanial drugs.  For the treatment of mucosal (caused by Leishmania braziliensis), cutaneous (caused by L. braziliensis, L. guyanensis, and L. panamensis), and visceral leishmaniasis (caused by L. donovani). In comparing Leishmania drug susceptibility, it has been found that L. donovani is the most susceptible to miltefosine while L. major is the least susceptible.

It conjugates to drugs to make them more soluble for excretion, is a cofactor for some enzymes, is involved in protein disulfide bond rearrangement and reduces peroxides. Glutathione (GSH) participates in leukotriene synthesis and is a cofactor for the enzyme glutathione peroxidase. It also plays a role in the hepatic biotransformation and detoxification process; it acts as a hydrophilic molecule that is added to other lipophilic toxins or wastes prior to entering biliary excretion. It participates in the detoxification of methylglyoxal, a toxic by-product of metabolism, mediated by glyoxalase enzymes. Glyoxalase I catalyzes the conversion of methylglyoxal and reduced glutathione to S-D-Lactoyl-glutathione. Glyoxalase II catalyzes the conversion of S-D-Lactoyl Glutathione to Reduced Glutathione and D-lactate. Glyoxalase I catalyzes the conversion of methylglyoxal and reduced glutathione to S-D-Lactoyl-glutathione. Glyoxalase II catalyzes the conversion of S-D-Lactoyl Glutathione to Reduced Glutathione and D-lactate. GSH is a cofactor of conjugation and reduction reactions that are catalyzed by glutathione S-transferase enzymes expressed in the cytosol, microsomes, and mitochondria. However, it is capable of participating in non-enzymatic conjugation with some chemicals, as it is hypothesized to do to a significant extent with n-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), the reactive cytochrome P450 reactive metabolite formed by toxic overdose of acetaminophen. Glutathione in this capacity binds to NAPQI as a suicide substrate and in the process detoxifies it, taking the place of cellular protein sulfhydryl groups which would otherwise be toxically adducted. The preferred medical treatment to an overdose of this nature, whose efficacy has been consistently supported in literature, is the administration (usually in atomized form) of N-acetylcysteine, which is used by cells to replace spent GSSG and allow a usable GSH pool.

      "Nicotine_(14880),\"Nicotine belongs to drug node. Nicotine is highly toxic alkaloid. It is the prototypical agonist at nicotinic cholinergic receptors where it dramatically stimulates neurons and ultimately blocks synaptic transmission. Nicotine is also important medically because of its presence in tobacco smoke. Nicotine is a stimulant drug that acts as an agonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. These are ionotropic receptors composed up of five homomeric or heteromeric subunits. In the brain, nicotine binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on dopaminergic neurons in the cortico-limbic pathways. This causes the channel to open and allow conductance of multiple cations including sodium, calcium, and potassium. This leads to depolarization, which activates voltage-gated calcium channels and allows more calcium to enter the axon terminal. Calcium stimulates vesicle trafficking towards the plasma membrane and the release of dopamine into the synapse. Dopamine binding to its receptors is responsible the euphoric and addictive properties of nicotine. Less than 5% Nicotine, the primary alkaloid in tobacco products binds stereo-selectively to nicotinic-cholinergic receptors on autonomic ganglia, the adrenal medulla, neuromuscular junctions and in the brain. Nicotine exerts two effects, a stimulant effect exerted at the locus ceruleus and a reward effect in the limbic system. Itranvenous administration of nicotine causes release of acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonine, vasopressin, beta-endorphin and ACTH. Nicotine is a highly addictive substance. Nicotine also induces peripheral vasoconstriction, tachycardia and elevated blood pressure. Nicotine inhalers and patches are used to treat smoking withdrawl syndrome.

It is a tertiary amine that can be presented as (E) and (Z) stereoisomers with the (Z) stereoisomer corresponding to. Doxepin commonly produces a 5:1 (E):(Z) racemic mixture.  Doxepin exact mechanism of action is not very clear. However, doxepin is known to be a selective histamine H1 receptor blocker. This effect on histamine receptors indicates effectiveness in skin conditions. Equilibrium dialysis indicates a mean protein binding of 75.5% for doxepin and 76% for desmethyldoxepin. Similar to other tricyclic antidepressants, doxepin was shown, in preclinical trials, to decrease the electrical activity of the brain, prolong the hexobarbital-induced sleep and block avoidance behavior without affecting the conditioned emotional response. At high doses, it also produces symptoms of central nervous system depression. Oral doxepin is approved for the following indications:\"\n",
      "Arsenic trioxide_(14313),\"Arsenic trioxide belongs to drug node. Arsenic trioxide is a chemotherapeutic agent of idiopathic function used to treat leukemia that is unresponsive to first line agents. It is suspected that arsenic trisulfide induces cancer cells to undergo apoptosis. In general, arsenic is known to be a naturally toxic substance capable of eliciting a variety of dangerous adverse effects. The enzyme thioredoxin reductase has recently been identified as a target for arsenic trioxide. The mechanism of action of Arsenic Trioxide is not completely understood. Arsenic trioxide causes morphological changes and DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis in NB4 human promyelocytic leukemia cells <i>in vitro</i>. Arsenic trioxide also causes damage or degradation of the fusion protein PML/RAR-alpha.

      "Naloxone_(14314),\"Naloxone belongs to drug node. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist medication used to block or reverse the effects of opioid drugs, particularly within the setting of drug overdoses which are rapidly becoming a leading cause of death worldwide. More specifically, naloxone has a high affinity for μ-opioid receptors, where it acts as an inverse agonist, causing the rapid removal of any other drugs bound to these receptors. When taken in large quantities, opioid medications such as , , , , or are capable of causing life-threatening symptoms such as respiratory depression, reduced heart rate, slurred speech, drowsiness, and constricted pupils. If untreated, this can progress to vomiting, absent pulse and breathing, loss of consciousness, and even death. Naloxone is indicated for the rapid reversal of these symptoms of central nervous system depression in opioid overdose. It's important to note that naloxone only works on opioid receptors within the body, and is therefore not capable of reversing the effects of non-opioid medications such as stimulants like or , or benzodiazepines like or.  While the mechanism of action of naloxone is not fully understood, the preponderance of evidence suggests that naloxone antagonizes the opioid effects by competing for the same receptor sites, especially the mu-opioid receptor. Recently, naloxone has been shown to bind all three opioid receptors (mu, kappa and gamma) but the strongest binding is to the mu receptor. Plasma protein binding occurs but is relatively weak. Plasma albumin is the major binding constituent but significant binding of naloxone also occurs to plasma constituents other than albumin. Naloxone is an opiate antagonist and prevents or reverses the effects of opioids including respiratory depression, sedation and hypotension. In the absence of narcotics or agonistic effects of other narcotic antagonists, it exhibits essentially no pharmacologic activity.  For the complete or partial reversal of narcotic depression, including respiratory depression, induced by opioids including natural and synthetic narcotics, propoxyphene, methadone and the narcotic-antagonist analgesics: nalbuphine, pentazocine and butorphanol. It is also indicated for the diagnosis of suspected acute opioid overdose. It may also be used as an adjunctive agent to increase blood pressure in the management of septic shock.\"\n",
      "Flecainide_(14316),\"Flecainide belongs to drug node. Flecainide is a Class I anti-arrhythmic agent like and. Flecainide’s development began in 1966 and was first synthesized in 1972 as an attempt to generate new anesthetics. It is used to prevent supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, as well as paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and flutter. Flecainide blocks fast inward sodium channels and slowly unbinds during diastole, prolonging the refractory period of the heart. This blockade also shortens the duration of action potentials through the Purkinjie fibers. Flecainide also prevents delayed rectifier potassium channels from opening, lengthening the action potential through ventricular and atrial muscle fibers. Finally, flecainide also blocks ryanodine receptor opening, reducing calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum, which reduces depolarization of cells. Flecainide is 40% bound to protein in serum, mainly to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein and minorly to serum albumin. Flecainide inhibits the action of sodium and potassium ion channels in the heart, raising the threshold for depolarization and correcting arrhythmias. Flecainide has a long duration of action, allowing for once daily dosing. The therapeutic index is narrow. Patients should not take this medication if there is already structural heart disease or left ventricular systolic dysfunction. In New Zealand and America, flecainide is indicated to prevent supraventricular arrhythmias and ventricular arrhythmias. In the United States, it is also indicated to prevent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and flutter.\"\n",
      "Captopril_(14317),\"Captopril belongs to drug node. Captopril is a potent, competitive inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), the enzyme responsible for the conversion of angiotensin I (ATI) to angiotensin II (ATII). ATII regulates blood pressure and is a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Captopril may be used in the treatment of hypertension. There are two isoforms of ACE: the somatic isoform, which exists as a glycoprotein comprised of a single polypeptide chain of 1277; and the testicular isoform, which has a lower molecular mass and is thought to play a role in sperm maturation and binding of sperm to the oviduct epithelium. Somatic ACE has two functionally active domains, N and C, which arise from tandem gene duplication. Although the two domains have high sequence similarity, they play distinct physiological roles. The C-domain is predomitly involved in blood pressure regulation while the N-domain plays a role in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and proliferation. ACE inhibitors bind to and inhibit the activity of both domains, but have much greater affinity for and inhibitory activity against the C-domain. Captopril, one of the few ACE inhibitors that is not a prodrug, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII. Decreasing ATII levels in the body decreases blood pressure by inhibiting the pressor effects of ATII as described in the Pharmacology section above. Captopril also causes an increase in plasma renin activity likely due to a loss of feedback inhibition mediated by ATII on the release of renin and/or stimulation of reflex mechanisms via baroreceptors. Captopril’s affinity for ACE is approximately 30,000 times greater than that of ATI. 25-30% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin Captopril, an ACE inhibitor, antagonizes the effect of the RAAS. The RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from the granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. In the blood stream, renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to ATI, which is subsequently cleaved to ATII by ACE. ATII increases blood pressure using a number of mechanisms. First, it stimulates the secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone travels to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and collecting tubule of nephrons where it increases sodium and water reabsorption by increasing the number of sodium channels and sodium-potassium ATPases on cell membranes. Second, ATII stimulates the secretion of vasopressin (also known as antidiuretic hormone or ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland. ADH stimulates further water reabsorption from the kidneys via insertion of aquaporin-2 channels on the apical surface of cells of the DCT and collecting tubules. Third, ATII increases blood pressure through direct arterial vasoconstriction. Stimulation of the Type 1 ATII receptor on vascular smooth muscle cells leads to a cascade of events resulting in myocyte contraction and vasoconstriction. In addition to these major effects, ATII induces the thirst response via stimulation of hypothalamic neurons. ACE inhibitors inhibit the rapid conversion of ATI to ATII and antagonize RAAS-induced increases in blood pressure. ACE (also known as kininase II) is also involved in the enzymatic deactivation of bradykinin, a vasodilator. Inhibiting the deactivation of bradykinin increases bradykinin levels and may sustain its effects by causing increased vasodilation and decreased blood pressure. For the treatment of essential or renovascular hypertension (usually administered with other drugs, particularly thiazide diuretics). May be used to treat congestive heart failure in combination with other drugs (e.g. cardiac glycosides, diuretics, &beta;-adrenergic blockers). May improve survival in patients with left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction. May be used to treat nephropathy, including diabetic nephropathy. \"\n",
      "Ceftriaxone_(14318),\"Ceftriaxone belongs to drug node. Ceftriaxone is a broad-spectrum third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic. It has a very long half-life compared to other cephalosporins and is high penetrable into the meninges, eyes, and inner ear. Ceftriaxone has broader and stronger gram-negative coverage then first or second-generation cephalosporins, but worse activity against methicillin-susceptible S.aureus. Ceftriaxone is a commonly used antimicrobial due to its good activity against multi-drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae, its relatively safe adverse effect profile, and its long half-life which allows for the convenience of daily or twice-daily dosing. Ceftriaxone works by inhibiting the mucopeptide synthesis in the bacterial cell wall. The beta-lactam moiety of ceftriaxone binds to carboxypeptidases, endopeptidases, and transpeptidases in the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. These enzymes are involved in cell-wall synthesis and cell division. Binding of ceftriaxone to these enzymes causes the enzyme to lose activity; therefore, the bacteria produce defective cell walls, causing cell death. Ceftriaxone is 95% protein bound. Ceftriaxone is a cephalosporin/cephamycin beta-lactam antibiotic used in the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible, usually gram-positive, organisms. Ceftriaxone has <i>in vitro</i> activity against gram-positive aerobic, gram-negative aerobic, and anaerobic bacteria. The bactericidal activity of ceftriaxone results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through ceftriaxone binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Ceftriaxone is stable against hydrolysis by a variety of beta-lactamases, including penicillinases, and cephalosporinases and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. However, resistance to ceftriaxone usually occurs through beta-lactamase hydrolysis, altered PBPs, or reduced bacterial cell permeability. Ceftriaxone should not be mixed with or giving in the same IV line as diluents/products containing calcium as they may cause ceftriaxone to precipitate. Ceftriaxone use may also cause biliary sludge or gallbladder pseudolithiasis.  Ceftriaxone is used for the treatment of the infections (respiratory, skin, soft tissue, UTI, ENT) caused by susceptible organisms. Organisms that are generally susceptible to ceftriaxone include S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes (group A beta-hemolytic streptococci), coagulase-negative staphylococci, Some Enterobacter spp, H. influenzae, N. gonorrhoeae, P. mirabilis, E. coli, Klebsiella spp, M. catarrhalis, B. burgdorferi, and some oral anaerobes. \"\n",
      "Saquinavir_(14319),\"Saquinavir belongs to drug node. Saquinavir is an HIV-1 protease inhibitor used in combination with and other antiretrovirals for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection. In 1995 it became the first protease inhibitor approved by the FDA, followed shortly by ritonavir in 1996, and remains in clinical use today due to a relatively benign adverse effect profile as compared to other antiretroviral therapies. While its efficacy was initially limited by exceptionally poor oral bioavailability (approximately 4%), its current indications require the co-administration of ritonavir - a potent enzyme inhibitor - that increases the bioavailability and subsequent serum concentrations of saquinavir, thus dramatically improving antiviral activity. The HIV lifecycle is comprised of 3 distinct stages: assembly, involving creation and packaging of essential viral components; budding, wherein the viral particle crosses the host cell plasma membrane and forms a lipid envelope; and maturation, wherein the viral particle alters its structure and becomes infectious. At the center of this lifecycle is the Gag polyprotein which, along with the products of its proteolysis, coordinate these stages and function as the major structural proteins of the virus. The HIV-1 protease enzyme, a dimeric aspartic protease, is the enzyme responsible for cleaving the Gag polyprotein and thus plays a critical role in many aspects of the HIV viral lifecycle. Saquinavir is approximately 98% plasma protein-bound independent of serum concentration. Saquinavir exerts its antiviral activity by inhibiting an enzyme critical for the HIV-1 viral lifecycle. Like other protease inhibitors, saquinavir has a propensity for participating in drug interactions - use caution when administering saquinavir to patients maintained on other pharmaceutical agents as pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions are common. Saquinavir is known to increase the QTc-interval in otherwise healthy individuals, and should therefore be used with caution in patients maintained on other QTc-prolonging medications or for whom prolongation of the QTc-interval may be of particular consequence (e.g. patients with pre-existing heart disease). Careful and regular monitoring of patient bloodwork is recommended, as saquinavir has been associated with the development of metabolic complications (e.g. diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia) and worsening of pre-existing liver disease. Saquinavir is indicated, in combination with ritonavir and other antiretroviral agents, for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in patients 16 years of age and older.\"\n",
      "Dexamethasone_(14320),\"Dexamethasone belongs to drug node. Dexamethasone, or MK-125, is a corticosteroid fluorinated at position 9 used to treat endocrine, rheumatic, collagen, dermatologic, allergic, ophthalmic, gastrointestinal, respiratory, hematologic, neoplastic, edematous, and other conditions. Developed in 1957, it is structurally similar to other corticosteroids like and. The short term effects of corticosteroids are decreased vasodilation and permeability of capillaries, as well as decreased leukocyte migration to sites of inflammation. Corticosteroids binding to the glucocorticoid receptor mediates changes in gene expression that lead to multiple downstream effects over hours to days. Dexamethasone is approximately 77% protein bound in plasma. The majority of protein binding is with serum albumin. Dexamethasone does not significantly bind to corticosteroid binding protein. Corticosteroids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor, inhibiting pro-inflammatory signals, and promoting anti-inflammatory signals. Dexamethasone's duration of action varies depending on the route. Corticosteroids have a wide therapeutic window as patients may require doses that are multiples of what the body naturally produces. Patients taking corticosteroids should be counselled regarding the risk of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression and increased susceptibility to infections. Dexamethasone and otic suspension is indicated for bacterial infections with inflammation in acute otitis media and acute otitis externa. Intramuscular and intravenous injections are indicated for a number of endocrine, rheumatic, collagen, dermatologic, allergic, ophthalmic, gastrointestinal, respiratory, hematologic, neoplastic, edematous, and other conditions. Oral tablets are indicated for the treatment of multiple myeloma. An intravitreal implant is indicated for some forms of macular edema and non-infectious posterior uveitis affecting the posterior of the eye. Various ophthalmic formulations are indicated for inflammatory conditions of the eye.\"\n",
      "Gemfibrozil_(14324),\"Gemfibrozil belongs to drug node. Gemfibrozil is a fibric acid agent, similar to , used to treat Type IIb, IV, and V hyperlipidemias. Gemfibrozil is not a first line treatment and is prescribed to patients who have not responded adequately to weight loss, diet, exercise, and other medications. Gemfibrozil activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα), which alters lipid metabolism. This activation leads to increased HDL, apo AI, apo AII, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), inhibition of apo B synthesis, peripheral lipolysis, decreased removal of free fatty acids by the liver, and increased clearance of apoB. Gemfibrozil is 99% protein bound. It is 98.6% bound to serum albumin, 0.8% bound to erythrocytes, and 0.8% unbound. There is negligible binding to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Gemfibrozil alters lipid metabolism to treat patients with hyperlipidemia. The duration of action requires twice daily dosing as the mean residence time of gemfibrozil is up to 9.6h in patients with chronic renal failure. Gemfibrozil has a wide therapeutic index as trials with twice the standard dose were not associated with severe side effects. Patients taking gemfibrozil may be at an increased risk of developing cholelithiasis and cholecystitis, as seen in patients taking. Gemfibrozil is indicated to treat patients with Types IV and V hyperlipidemia who have elevated serum triglycerides (usually above 2000mg/dL), elevated VLDL cholesterol, fasting chylomicrons, are at risk of developing pancreatitis, and do not adequately respond to dietary restrictions. Gemfibrozil is also indicated to reduce the risk of developing coronary heart disease in patients with Type IIb hyperlipidemia without history or symptoms of coronary heart disease; who do not adequately respond to weight loss, diet, exercise, and other medications; and have low HDL, raised LDL, and raised triglycerides.\"\n",
      "Clomipramine_(14325),\"Clomipramine belongs to drug node. Clomipramine, the 3-chloro analog of imipramine, is a dibenzazepine-derivative tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). TCAs are structurally similar to phenothiazines. They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, clomipramine does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, clomipramine exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Tertiary amine TCAs, such as clomipramine, are more potent inhibitors of serotonin reuptake than secondary amine TCAs, such as nortriptyline and desipramine. TCAs also down-regulate cerebral cortical &beta;-adrenergic receptors and sensitize post-synaptic serotonergic receptors with chronic use. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. TCAs also block histamine-H<sub>1</sub> receptors, &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively. See toxicity section below for a complete listing of side effects. Clomipramine may be used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder and disorders with an obsessive-compulsive component (e.g. depression, schizophrenia, Tourette’s disorder). Unlabeled indications include panic disorder, chronic pain (e.g. central pain, idiopathic pain disorder, tension headache, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, neuropathic pain), cataplexy and associated narcolepsy, autistic disorder, trichotillomania, onchophagia, stuttering, premature ejaculation, and premenstrual syndrome. Clomipramine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and demethylated in the liver to its primary active metabolite, desmethylclomipramine. Clomipramine is a strong, but not completely selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI), as the active main metabolite desmethyclomipramine acts preferably as an inhibitor of noradrenaline reuptake. &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-receptor blockage and &beta;-down-regulation have been noted and most likely play a role in the short term effects of clomipramine. A blockade of sodium-channels and NDMA-receptors might, as with other tricyclics, account for its effect in chronic pain, in particular the neuropathic type. Clomipramine is approximately 97-98% bound to plasma proteins, principally to albumin and possibly to &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-acid glycoprotein. Desmethylclomipramine is 97-99% bound to plasma proteins.  Clomipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, is the 3-chloro derivative of Imipramine. It was thought that tricyclic antidepressants work exclusively by inhibiting the re-uptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin by nerve cells. However, this response occurs immediately, yet mood does not lift for around two weeks. It is now thought that changes occur in receptor sensitivity in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The hippocampus is part of the limbic system, a part of the brain involved in emotions. Presynaptic receptors are affected: &alpha;<sub>1</sub> and &beta;<sub>1</sub> receptors are sensitized, &alpha;<sub>2</sub> receptors are desensitized (leading to increased noradrenaline production). Tricyclics are also known as effective analgesics for different types of pain, especially neuropathic or neuralgic pain. May be used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder and disorders with an obsessive-compulsive component (e.g. depression, schizophrenia, Tourette’s disorder).\"\n",
      "Darunavir_(14326),\"Darunavir belongs to drug node. Darunavir is a protease inhibitor used with other HIV protease inhibitor drugs as well as for the effective management of HIV-1 infection. As a second-generation protease inhibitor, darunavir is designed to combat resistance to standard HIV therapy. It was initially approved by the FDA in 2006. The HIV-1 protease enzyme is necessary for viral precursor protein processing and viral maturation in preparation for infection, and is therefore a target for antiretroviral therapy for HIV. Protease inhibitors are used as a part of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in patients diagnosed with HIV infection. It has been shown to effectively suppress the virus, leading to significantly decreased morbidity and mortality rates. Darunavir is approximately 95% bound to plasma proteins. Darunavir binds primarily to plasma alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG). Darunavir is an inhibitor of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease, which prevents HIV viral replication. When administered with ritonavir in combination antiretroviral therapy, darunavir significantly decreases viral load and increases CD4 cell counts, decreasing the morbidity and mortality of HIV infection. Darunavir, co-administered with ritonavir, and with other antiretroviral agents, is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in children age 3 or above and adults with HIV-1 infection. \"\n",
      "Colchicine_(14338),\"Colchicine belongs to drug node. First approved by the FDA in 1961, colchicine is an alkaloid drug commonly used in the management of gout, a condition associated with the painful deposition of urate crystals in the joints. It is derived from a plant belonging to the Lily family, known as Colchicum autumnale, or \\autumn crocus\\\"\". Other than its use in gout, colchicine has been approved for managing exacerbations of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), a hereditary autoinflammatory condition.\"\" The exact mechanism of action of colchicine has not been fully established, however likely occurs via the downstream inhibition of inflammation caused by tubulin disruption. Studies have implied that that colchicine causes disruption of the inflammasome complex that is present in both monocytes and neutrophils, which normally leads to the activation of interleukin-1, an important mediator of inflammation. In addition to the above actions, colchicine acts to interfere with pathways including neutrophil adhesion and recruitment, superoxide production, the RhoA/Rho effector kinase (ROCK) pathway, as well as a type of nuclear factor κΒ (NF-κΒ) pathway, reducing inflammation.  The plasma protein binding for colchicine is low to moderate, at 39 ± 5%, and it is mainly bound to albumin. Colchicine reduces the pain resulting from gout and reduces flares of Familial Mediterranean fever by interfering with inflammatory pathways. This drug has a narrow therapeutic index. Colchicine is indicated for the prophylaxis and treatment of gout flares. It is also indicated in Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) in children and adults of 4 years of age and older. It is important to note that this medication is not a pain reliever to be used for other painful conditions. Consider analgesics for this purpose. Some off-label uses of colchicine include the treatment of the manifestations of Behcet's syndrome, pericarditis, and postpericardiotomy syndrome.\"\n",

It has a longer half-life than digoxin; toxic effects, which are similar to those of digoxin, are longer lasting. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p665) Digitoxin inhibits the Na-K-ATPase membrane pump, resulting in an increase in intracellular sodium and calcium concentrations. Increased intracellular concentrations of calcium may promote activation of contractile proteins (e.g., actin, myosin). Digitoxin also acts on the electrical activity of the heart, increasing the slope of phase 4 depolarization, shortening the action potential duration, and decreasing the maximal diastolic potential.  Digitoxin is a cardiac glycoside sometimes used in place of DIGOXIN. It has a longer half-life than digoxin; toxic effects, which are similar to those of digoxin, are longer lasting (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p665).

      "Acenocoumarol_(14341),\"Acenocoumarol belongs to drug node. Acenocoumarol is a coumarin derivative used as an anticoagulant. Coumarin derivatives inhibit the reduction of vitamin K by vitamin K reductase. This prevents carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, II, VII, IX and X, and interferes with coagulation. Hematocrit, hemoglobin, international normalized ratio and liver panel should be monitored. Patients on acenocoumarol are prohibited from giving blood. Acenocoumarol inhibits vitamin K reductase, resulting in depletion of the reduced form of vitamin K (vitamin KH2). As vitamin K is a cofactor for the carboxylation of glutamate residues on the N-terminal regions of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, this limits the gamma-carboxylation and subsequent activation of the vitamin K-dependent coagulant proteins. The synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X and anticoagulant proteins C and S is inhibited resulting in decreased prothrombin levels and a decrease in the amount of thrombin generated and bound to fibrin. This reduces the thrombogenicity of clots. 98.7% protein bound, mainly to albumin Acenocoumarol inhibits the reduction of vitamin K by vitamin K reductase. This prevents carboxylation of certain glutamic acid residues near the N-terminals of clotting factors II, VII, IX and X, the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Glutamic acid carboxylation is important for the interaction between these clotting factors and calcium. Without this interaction, clotting cannot occur. Both the extrinsic (via factors VII, X and II) and intrinsic (via factors IX, X and II) are affected by acenocoumarol. For the treatment and prevention of thromboembolic diseases. More specifically, it is indicated for the prevention of cerebral embolism, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, thromboembolism in infarction and transient ischemic attacks.

      "Testosterone propionate_(14342),\"Testosterone propionate belongs to drug node. Testosterone propionate is a slower releasing anabolic steroid with a short half-life. This characteristic allows the user to run short testosterone propionate cycles of 8-10 weeks as optimal peak blood plasma levels are achieved at 2-4 weeks. It is a synthetic androstane steroid derivative of testosterone in the form of 17β propionate ester of testosterone. Testosterone propionate was developed initially by Watson labs, and FDA approved on February 5, 1974. Currently, this drug has been discontinued in humans, but the vet application is still available as an OTC. The effects of testosterone in humans and other vertebrates occur by way of two main mechanisms: by activation of the androgen receptor (directly or as DHT), and by conversion to estradiol and activation of certain estrogen receptors. Free testosterone (T) is transported into the cytoplasm of target tissue cells, where it can bind to the androgen receptor, or can be reduced to 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme 5alpha-reductase. The areas of binding are called hormone response elements (HREs), and influence transcriptional activity of certain genes, producing the androgen effects. Even 98% of testosterone in plasma is bound to sex hormone-binding globulin and 2% remains unbound or bound to albumin and other proteins. The administration of testosterone propionate can induce production of proteins related to male sexual development. On the other hand, testosterone itself present an estrogenic activity due to interaction with aromatase enzyme, thus the continuous aministration of testosterone propionate may cause the elevation of plasma estrogen. Clinical trials showed as well, a decrease in plasma LH after testosterone propionate administration. Testosterone propionate is often used for muscle mass building. The original medical indication is for the treatment of androgen deficiency in male adults either in hypogonadism or andropause. Nowadays testosterone propionate is indicated for its use in heifers in order to stimulate maximal growth.\"\n",
      "Ketazolam_(14345),\"Ketazolam belongs to drug node. Ketazolam is a benzodiazepine derivative with anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant activity. Ketazolam is not approved in Canada or America. Benzodiazepines share a similar chemical structure and their effects in humans are mainly produced by the allosteric modification of a specific kind of neurotransmitter receptor, the GABAA receptor, which increases the conductance of this inhibitory channel; this results in the various therapeutic effects as well as adverse effects of benzodiazepines. Binding of benzodiazepines to this receptor complex promotes binding of GABA, which in turn increases the conduction of chloride ions across the neuronal cell membrane. This increased conductance raises the membrane potential of the neuron resulting in inhibition of neuronal firing. In addition, different GABAA receptor subtypes have varying distributions within different regions of the brain and therefore control distinct neuronal circuits. Hence, activation of different GABAA receptor subtypes by benzodiazepines may result in distinct pharmacological actions.  Benzodiazepines enhance the effect of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which results in sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant and amnesic action. Ketazolam could be used for the treatment of anxiety. In approved countries, it is indicated for the treatment of anxiety, tension, irritability and similar stress related symptoms.\"\n",

Triptans can be administered alone or in combination with an NSAID like , and represent the current \\gold standard\\\"\" for acute migraine treatment.\"\" Migraines are complex physiological events characterized by unilateral throbbing headaches combined with photophobia and other aversions to sensory input. Migraine attacks are generally divided into phases: the premonitory phase, which typically involves irritability, fatigue, yawning, and stiff neck; the headache phase, which lasts for between four and 72 hours; and the postdrome phase, which lasts for up to a day following resolution of pain and whose symptoms are similar to those of the premonitory phase. In addition, neurological deficits, collectively termed migraine aura, may precede the headache phase. Zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite remain approximately 25% bound to plasma proteins over a concentration range of 10-1000 ng/mL. Zolmitriptan, like other triptans, is a serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) receptor agonist, with enhanced specificity for the 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptor subtypes. It is through the downstream effects of 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> activation that triptans are proposed to provide acute relief of migraines. Zolmitriptan is also a vasoconstrictor, leading to possible adverse cardiovascular effects such as myocardial ischemia/infarction, arrhythmias, cerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, gastrointestinal ischemia, and peripheral vasospastic reactions. In addition, chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, and/or pressure has been reported, along with the possibility of medication overuse headaches and serotonin syndrome. Patients with phenylketonuria should be advised that ZOMIG-ZMT contains phenylalanine. Zolmitriptan is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without auras in patients aged 18 and over.\"\n",
      "Sumatriptan_(14899),\"Sumatriptan belongs to drug node. Sumatriptan is a serotonin receptor agonist commonly used to treat migraines and sometimes cluster headaches. Sumatriptan is the first of the triptans and was made available in Europe in 1991 to treat migraines. Sumatriptan was granted FDA approval on 28 December 1992. Sumatriptan is an agonist of 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>. This agonism leads to constriction of cranial blood vessels and inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory neuropeptides. Sumatriptan decreases carotid arterial blood flow, but increases blood flow velocity in the internal carotid artery and middle cerebral artery. Sumatriptan is 14%-21% bound to protein in circulation. Sumatriptan constricts cranial blood vessels and prevents the release of vasoactive peptides. The dose of sumatriptan varies widely by route of administration and in most cases, no more than 2 doses should be given daily. Medication overuse headaches may occur in patients who use sumatriptan frequently. A combination sumatriptan and tablet is indicated for the treatment of migraines with or without auras in patients 12 years of age and older. Sumatriptan nasal powder, nasal spray, subcutaneous injection, and tablets are indicated to treat migraines with or without auras in adults. One of the subcutaneous formulations of sumatriptan is also indicated to treat cluster headaches in adults, while the other subcutaneous formulation is not.\"\n",
      "Ubrogepant_(14908),\"Ubrogepant belongs to drug node. Ubrogepant is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine headaches with or without aura in adults. It was approved by the FDA on December 23, 2019, and is the first oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist approved for the acute treatment of migraine. Several oral small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists, belonging to a class of medications referred to as \\gepants\\\"\", have been investigated for migraines, but only ubrogepant and remain in clinical development. Previous agents within this class were efficacious but limited by liver toxicity - this led to the development of ubrogepant, which was designed to be a hepatoxicity-free alternative to its predecessors. Several parenteral monoclonal antibodies acting against the CGRP pathway (e.g. , , ) have also been approved in recent years.\"\" The currently accepted theory of migraine pathophysiology considers dysfunction of the central nervous system, in particular the trigeminal ganglion, to be the root cause behind the condition. Activation of the trigeminal ganglion triggers the stimulation of trigeminal afferents that project to the spinal cord and synapse on various pain-sensing intra- and extracranial structures, such as the dura mater. Pain signals are then further transmitted via second-order ascending neurons to the brainstem, hypothalamus, and thalamic nuclei, and from there to several cortical regions (e.g. auditory, visual, motor cortices). The trigeminal ganglion appears to amplify and perpetuate the migraine headache pain through the activation of perivascular fibers and the release of molecules involved in pain generation, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Ubrogepant is 87% protein-bound _in vitro_, although the specific proteins to which ubrogepant binds have not been elucidated. Ubrogepant acutely treats migraine headache pain by blocking the activity of a key transmitter involved in migraine pathogenesis. Exposure to ubrogepant can be significantly increased in patients with severe hepatic or renal insufficiency - dose adjustments are required for these patients in order to avoid excessive exposure, and ubrogepant is not recommended in patients with end-stage renal disease. Ubrogepant is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults.\"\n",
      "Trifluoperazine_(14913),\"Trifluoperazine belongs to drug node. A phenothiazine with actions similar to chlorpromazine. It is used as an antipsychotic and an antiemetic. Trifluoperazine blocks postsynaptic mesolimbic dopaminergic D1 and D2 receptors in the brain; depresses the release of hypothalamic and hypophyseal hormones and is believed to depress the reticular activating system thus affecting basal metabolism, body temperature, wakefulness, vasomotor tone, and emesis.  Trifluoperazine is a trifluoro-methyl phenothiazine derivative intended for the management of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Trifluoperazine has not been shown effective in the management of behaviorial complications in patients with mental retardation.

      "Cyclosporine_(14934),\"Cyclosporine belongs to drug node. Cyclosporine is a calcineurin inhibitor known for its immunomodulatory properties that prevent organ transplant rejection and treat various inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. It is isolated from the fungus _Beauveria nivea_. Initially manufactured by Sandoz and approved for use by the FDA in 1983, cyclosporine is now available in various products by Novartis (previously known as Sandoz). Cyclosporine is a calcineurin inhibitor that inhibits T cell activation. Its binding to the receptor cyclophilin-1 inside cells produces a complex known as cyclosporine-cyclophilin. This complex subsequently inhibits calcineurin, which in turn stops the dephosphorylation as well as the activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) that normally cause inflammatory reactions. NF-AT is a transcription factor that promotes the production of cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, interferon-gamma and TNF-alpha, all of which are involved in the inflammatory process. Specifically, the inhibition of IL-2, which is necessary for T cell activation or proliferation, is believed to be responsible for cyclosporine's immunosuppressive actions. In addition to the above, the inhibition of NF-AT leads to lower levels of other factors associated with T helper cell function and thymocyte development. About 50% of the administered dose is taken up by erythrocytes while about 34% is bound to lipoproteins. Prescribing information for Sandimmune states that 90% is mainly bound to lipoproteins. Cyclosporine exerts potent immunosuppressive actions on T cells, thereby prolonging survival following organ and bone marrow transplants. This drug prevents and controls serious immune-mediated reactions including allograft rejection, graft versus host disease, and inflammatory autoimmune disease. Cyclosporine is approved for a variety of conditions. Firstly, it is approved for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in allogeneic kidney, liver, and heart transplants. It is also used to prevent bone marrow transplant rejection. For the above indications, cyclosporine can be used in conjunction with azathioprine and corticosteroids. Finally, cyclosporine can be used in patients who have chronic transplant rejection and have received previous immunosuppressive therapy and to prevent or treat graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).\"\n",
      "Fluconazole_(14935),\"Fluconazole belongs to drug node. Fluconazole, commonly known as _Diflucan_, is an antifungal drug used for the treatment of both systemic and superficial fungal infections in a variety of tissues. It was initially approved by the FDA in 1990. This drug is an _azole_ antifungal, in the same drug family as and. Fluconazole has many advantages over the other antifungal drugs including the option of oral administration. The side effect profile of this drug is minimal. It has been demonstrated as an efficacious treatment for vaginal yeast infections in one single dose. Fluconazole is a very selective inhibitor of fungal cytochrome P450 dependent enzyme _lanosterol 14-α-demethylase_. This enzyme normally works to convert _lanosterol_ to _ergosterol_, which is necessary for fungal cell wall synthesis. The free nitrogen atom located on the azole ring of fluconazole binds with a single iron atom located in the heme group of lanosterol 14-α-demethylase. This prevents oxygen activation and, as a result, inhibits the demethylation of lanosterol, halting the process of ergosterol biosynthesis. Methylated sterols are then found to accumulate in the fungal cellular membrane, leading to an arrest of fungal growth. These accumulated sterols negatively affect the structure and function of the fungal cell plasma membrane. The protein binding of fluconazole is low and estimated to be 11 to 12%. Fluconazole has been demonstrated to show fungistatic activity against the majority of strains of the following microorganisms, curing fungal infections: Fluconazole can be administered in the treatment of the following fungal infections:\"\n",
      "Erythromycin_(14936),\"Erythromycin belongs to drug node. Erythromycin is a bacteriostatic antibiotic drug produced by a strain of Saccharopolyspora erythraea (formerly Streptomyces erythraeus) and belongs to the macrolide group of antibiotics which consists of , , and others. It was originally discovered in 1952. Erythromycin is widely used for treating a variety of infections, including those caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. It is available for administration in various forms, including intravenous, topical, and eye drop preparations. In order to replicate, bacteria require a specific process of protein synthesis, enabled by ribosomal proteins. Erythromycin acts by inhibition of protein synthesis by binding to the 23S ribosomal RNA molecule in the 50S subunit of ribosomes in susceptible bacterial organisms. It stops bacterial protein synthesis by inhibiting the transpeptidation/translocation step of protein synthesis and by inhibiting the assembly of the 50S ribosomal subunit. This results in the control of various bacterial infections. The strong affinity of macrolides, including erythromycin, for bacterial ribosomes, supports their broad‐spectrum antibacterial activities. Erythromycin demonstrates 93% serum protein binding in the erythromycin propionate form. Another resource indicates that erythromycin protein binding ranges from 80 to 90%. Macrolides, such as erythromycin, stop bacterial growth by inhibiting protein synthesis and translation, treating bacterial infections. Erythromycin does not exert effects on nucleic acid synthesis. This drug has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, effectively treating both in vitro and clinical infections. Despite this, it is important to perform bacterial susceptibility testing before administering this antibiotic, as resistance is a common issue that may affect treatment.  \"\n",
      "Sildenafil_(14937),\"Sildenafil belongs to drug node. In eliciting its mechanism of action, sildenafil ultimately prevents or minimizes the breakdown of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) by inhibiting cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). The result of doing so allows cGMP present in both the penis and pulmonary vasculature to elicit smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation that subsequently facilitates relief in pulmonary arterial hypertension and the increased flow of blood into the spongy erectile tissue of the penis that consequently allows it to grow in size and become erect and rigid. Sildenafil is an oral therapy for erectile dysfunction. In the natural setting, i.e. with sexual stimulation, it restores impaired erectile function by increasing blood flow to the penis. It is generally observed that sildenafil and its main circulating N-desmethyl metabolite are both estimated to be about 96% bound to plasma proteins. Nevertheless, it has been determined that protein binding for sildenafil is independent of total drug concentrations. In vitro studies have shown that sildenafil is selective for phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5). Its effect is more potent on PDE5 than on other known phosphodiesterases. In particular, there is a 10-times selectivity over PDE6 which is involved in the phototransduction pathway in the retina. There is an 80-times selectivity over PDE1, and over 700-times over PDE 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. And finally, sildenafil has greater than 4,000-times selectivity for PDE5 over PDE3, the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase isoform involved in the control of cardiac contractility. Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor that is predomitly employed for two primary indications:\"\n",
      "Reserpine_(14938),\"Reserpine belongs to drug node. An alkaloid found in the roots of Rauwolfia serpentina and R. vomitoria. Reserpine inhibits the uptake of norepinephrine into storage vesicles resulting in depletion of catecholamines and serotonin from central and peripheral axon terminals. It has been used as an antihypertensive and an antipsychotic as well as a research tool, but its adverse effects limit its clinical use. Reserpine's mechanism of action is through inhibition of the ATP/Mg<sup>2+</sup> pump responsible for the sequestering of neurotransmitters into storage vesicles located in the presynaptic neuron. The neurotransmitters that are not sequestered in the storage vesicle are readily metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO) causing a reduction in catecholamines. 62% Reserpine is an adrenergic blocking agent used to treat mild to moderate hypertension via the disruption of norepinephrine vesicular storage. The antihypertensive actions of Reserpine are a result of its ability to deplete catecholamines from peripheral sympathetic nerve endings. These substances are normally involved in controlling heart rate, force of cardiac contraction and peripheral resistance. For the treatment of hypertension\"\n",
      "Indinavir_(14939),\"Indinavir belongs to drug node. A potent and specific HIV protease inhibitor that appears to have good oral bioavailability.  Indinavir inhibits the HIV viral protease enzyme which prevents cleavage of the gag-pol polyprotein, resulting in noninfectious, immature viral particles. 60% Indinavir is a protease inhibitor with activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). Protease inhibitors block the part of HIV called protease. HIV-1 protease is an enzyme required for the proteolytic cleavage of the viral polyprotein precursors into the individual functional proteins found in infectious HIV-1. Indinavir binds to the protease active site and inhibits the activity of the enzyme. This inhibition prevents cleavage of the viral polyproteins resulting in the formation of immature non-infectious viral particles. Protease inhibitors are almost always used in combination with at least two other anti-HIV drugs. Indinavir is an antiretroviral drug for the treatment of HIV infection.\"\n",
      "Lidocaine_(14940),\"Lidocaine belongs to drug node. Ever since its discovery and availability for sale and use in the late 1940s, lidocaine has become an exceptionally commonly used medication. In particular, lidocaine's principal mode of action in acting as a local anesthetic that numbs the sensations of tissues means the agent is indicated for facilitating local anesthesia for a large variety of surgical procedures. It ultimately elicits its numbing activity by blocking sodium channels so that the neurons of local tissues that have the medication applied on are transiently incapable of signaling the brain regarding sensations. In doing so, however, it can block or decrease muscle contractile, resulting in effects like vasodilation, hypotension, and irregular heart rate, among others. As a result, lidocaine is also considered a class Ib anti-arrhythmic agent. Nevertheless, lidocaine's local anesthetic action sees its use in many medical situations or circumstances that may benefit from its action, including the treatment of premature ejaculation. Lidocaine is a local anesthetic of the amide type. It is used to provide local anesthesia by nerve blockade at various sites in the body. It does so by stabilizing the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action. In particular, the lidocaine agent acts on sodium ion channels located on the internal surface of nerve cell membranes. At these channels, neutral uncharged lidocaine molecules diffuse through neural sheaths into the axoplasm where they are subsequently ionized by joining with hydrogen ions. The resultant lidocaine cations are then capable of reversibly binding the sodium channels from the inside, keeping them locked in an open state that prevents nerve depolarization. As a result, with sufficient blockage, the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron will ultimately not depolarize and will thus fail to transmit an action potential. This facilitates an anesthetic effect by not merely preventing pain signals from propagating to the brain but by aborting their generation in the first place. The protein binding recorded for lidocaine is about 60 to 80% and is dependent upon the plasma concentration of alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Such percentage protein binding bestows lidocaine with a medium duration of action when placed in comparison to other local anesthetic agents. Excessive blood levels of lidocaine can cause changes in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, and mean arterial pressure. With central neural blockade these changes may be attributable to the block of autonomic fibers, a direct depressant effect of the local anesthetic agent on various components of the cardiovascular system, and/or the beta-adrenergic receptor stimulating action of epinephrine when present. The net effect is normally a modest hypotension when the recommended dosages are not exceeded. Lidocaine is an anesthetic of the amide group indicated for production of local or regional anesthesia by infiltration techniques such as percutaneous injection and intravenous regional anesthesia by peripheral nerve block techniques such as brachial plexus and intercostal and by central neural techniques such as lumbar and caudal epidural blocks.\"\n",
      "Terfenadine_(14942),\"Terfenadine belongs to drug node. In the U.S., Terfenadine was superseded by fexofenadine in the 1990s due to the risk of cardiac arrhythmia caused by QT interval prolongation. Terfenadine competes with histamine for binding at H1-receptor sites in the GI tract, uterus, large blood vessels, and bronchial muscle. This reversible binding of terfenadine to H1-receptors suppresses the formation of edema, flare, and pruritus resulting from histaminic activity. As the drug does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, CNS depression is minimal. 70% Terfenadine, an H1-receptor antagonist antihistamine, is similar in structure to astemizole and haloperidol, a butyrophenone antipsychotic.

      "Nisoldipine_(14946),\"Nisoldipine belongs to drug node. Nisoldipine is a 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. It acts primarily on vascular smooth muscle cells by stabilizing voltage-gated L-type calcium channels in their inactive conformation. By inhibiting the influx of calcium in smooth muscle cells, nisoldipine prevents calcium-dependent smooth muscle contraction and subsequent vasoconstriction. Nisoldipine may be used in alone or in combination with other agents in the management of hypertension. By deforming the channel, inhibiting ion-control gating mechanisms, and/or interfering with the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, Nisoldipine inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes The decrease in intracellular calcium inhibits the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells, causing dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure, and decreased afterload. 99% Nisoldipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, is used alone or with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, to treat hypertension, chronic stable angina pectoris, and Prinzmetal's variant angina.

Duvelisib, also known as IPI-145 and INK-1197, is a small-molecule inhibitor of phosphoinositide-3 kinases that was designed initially to prove that simultaneous inhibition of the isoforms delta and gamma can produce a broad adaptative and innate immune cell inhibitory activity. All the work around duvelisib showed that this agent is a potent inhibitor of both forms. Duvelisib was developed by Verastem, Inc and FDA approved on September 24, 2018. Duvelisib acts as a strong reversible inhibitor of the isoform gamma and delta of the phosphoinositide3-kinase (PI3K). PI3K plays a very important role in innate and adaptative immunity and the inhibition of the form delta and gamma has been very important for the suppression of immunity. The protein binding of duvelisib is greater than 98% and this level is not dependent on serum concentration. It is reported that duvelisib is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP. Preclinical data showed that duvelisib presents cytotoxic actions at micromolar doses and antagonizes the activation of downstream signaling even in the presence of the mutation BTK C481S, which allows for the treatment of patients resistant to ibrutinib.

Entrectinib is a tropomyosin receptor tyrosine kinase (TRK) TRKA, TRKB, TRKC, proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase ROS1, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor. It was approved by the FDA in August 2019 for use in the treatment of ROS1-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and NTRK gene fusion positive solid tumors. Entrectinib's approved use is meant as a last line of therapy due to its accelerated approval based on early trial data. This therapy offers benefit over similar ALK inhibitors such as , , and due to a wider range of targets. Entrectinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor which acts on several receptors. It functions as an ATP competitor to inhibit tropomyosin receptor tyrosine kinases (TRK) TRKA, TRKB, TRKC, as well as proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase ROS1 and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). TRK receptors produce cell proliferation via downstream signalling through the mitogen activated protein kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and phospholipase C-γ. ALK produces similar signalling with the addition of downstream JAK/STAT activation. Inhibition of these pathways suppresses cancer cell proliferation and shifts the balance in favor of apoptosis resulting in shrinking of tumor volume. Entrectinib is over 99% bound to plasma proteins. Entrectinib and its active metabolite suppress several pathways which contribute to cell survival and proliferation. This suppression shifts the balance in favor of apoptosis thereby preventing cancer cell growth and shrinking tumors. Entrectinib is indicated for the treatment of metastatic ROS1-positive non-small cell lung cancer in adults. Entrectinib is also indicated in adults and children over 12 years old for the treatment of NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumors which have metastasized or for which surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity and for which has progressed on previous therapies or for which no comparable alternative therapies are available.\"\n",

      "Alpelisib_(15675),\"Alpelisib belongs to drug node. Alpelisib is a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor with potent antitumor activity. It works by selectively inhibiting class I PI3K p110α , which is the catalytic subunit of PI3K, a lipid kinase that plays a role in various biological processes, including proliferation, survival, differentiation, and metabolism. Alpelisib was designed to target this enzyme that appears to be mutated at a rate of nearly 30% in human cancers, leading to hyperactivation.  Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-α (PI3Kα) is responsible for cell proliferation in response to growth factor-tyrosine kinase pathway activation. In some cancers PI3Kα's p110α catalytic subunit is mutated making it hyperactive. Alpelisib inhibits (PI3K), with the highest specificity for PI3Kα. Alpelisib is 89% protein bound. Alpelisib does not prolong the QTcF interval. Patients taking alpelisib experience a dose dependent benefit from treatment with a 51% advantage of a 200mg daily dose over a 100mg dose and a 22% advantage of 300mg once daily over 150mg twice daily.

In general, such urothelial cancers originate in the urothelium - or the transitional epithelium - a membrane that covers the renal pelvis to the ureter, the bladder, and the proximal two-thirds of the urethra. While 90 to 95% of urothelial cancers are bladder cancers and the other 5 to 10% are upper tract urothelial cancers, the bladder cancers can also be either superficial or invasive (either not having or having invaded the deeper layers of the bladder). The protein binding recorded for erdafitinib is approximately 99.8%, and it was determined to be primarily bound to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Upon administration, it was observed that erdafitinib increased serum phosphate level as a consequence of FGFR inhibition. Erdafitinib should be increased to the maximum recommended dose to achieve target serum phosphate levels of 5.5– 7.0 mg/dL in early cycles with continuous daily dosing. Erdafitinib is a pan-fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma that has:\"\n",
      "Rimegepant_(15687),\"Rimegepant belongs to drug node. Rimegepant is an oral antagonist of the CGRP receptor developed by Biohaven Pharmaceuticals. It received FDA approval on February 27, 2020 for the acute treatment migraine headache. While several parenteral antagonists of CGRP and its receptor have been approved for migraine therapy (e.g. , , ), rimegepant and are the only members of the \\gepants\\\"\" family of medications remaining in development, and the only CGRP antagonists that possess oral bioavailability.\"\" The currently accepted theory of migraine pathophysiology considers dysfunction of the central nervous system, in particular the trigeminal ganglion, to be the root cause behind the condition. Activation of the trigeminal ganglion triggers the stimulation of trigeminal afferents that project to the spinal cord and synapse on various pain-sensing intra- and extracranial structures, such as the dura mater. Pain signals are then further transmitted via second-order ascending neurons to the brainstem, hypothalamus, and thalamic nuclei, and from there to several cortical regions (e.g. auditory, visual, motor cortices). The trigeminal ganglion appears to amplify and perpetuate the migraine headache pain through the activation of perivascular fibers and the release of molecules involved in pain generation, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Rimegepant is approximately 96% plasma protein-bound. The specific proteins to which rimegepant binds have not been elucidated. Rimegepant helps to abort migraine headaches by preventing the activity of a pronociceptive molecule that has been implicated in migraine pathophysiology. It is intended for use as an abortive migraine therapy and therefore has a relatively rapid onset of effect, with most efficacy trials evaluating for effect at the 2 hour mark.  Rimegepant is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults.\"\n",

      "Lefamulin_(15697),\"Lefamulin belongs to drug node. Lefamulin is a pleuromutilin antibiotic used for the treatment of bacterial community-acquired pneumonia. A pleuromotilin is a more recently developed type of antibiotic that is derived from the fungus, Pleurotus mutilus. Lefamulin is available in intravenous and oral preparations and was granted FDA approval in August 2019. This drug is the first semi-synthetic pleuromutilin that has been designed for systemic administration. Lefamulin features a novel mechanism of action that shows benefit against resistant bacteria that cause pneumonia. The chemical structure of lefamulin contains a tricyclic mutilin core that is necessary for some of its antimicrobial activity. Lefamulin inhibits prokaryotic ribosomal protein synthesis via its binding to the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) of the ribosomal bacterial 50S subunit. It inhibits protein translation through binding to both the A and P sites of the PTC via four hydrogen bonds, resulting in the interruption of peptide bond formation. Lefamulin's tricyclic mutilin core is the common moiety for binding of all members of its drug class, the pleuromutilins. Although the tricyclic motilin core doesn’t form any hydrogen bonds with the PTC nucleotides, it is stabilized or anchored by hydrophobic and Van der Waals interactions. Lefamulin exerts a selective inhibition of protein translation in eukaryotes, however, does not affect ribosomal translation of eukaryotes. Lefamulin demonstrates a unique induced-fit type of action that closes the binding pocket within a ribosome, conferring close contact of the drug to its target, therefore improving therapeutic efficacy. Because of its mechanism of action that differs from that of other antimicrobials, cross-resistance to other antibiotic classes is less likely. The average plasma protein binding of lefamulin is between 94.8 to 97.1% in healthy adults. A systematic review identifies the plasma protein binding at 80-87%. Lefamulin demonstrates strong antibacterial activity against several microbes that are found to be common in both acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections as well as community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.  It shows antibacterial activity against gram-positive and atypical microbes (for example, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae). Lefamulin also exerts activity against Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. It does not treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. During in vitro studies, drug has also has demonstrated activity against Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Mycoplasma genitalium. Lefamulin is indicated to treat adults diagnosed with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) that is caused by susceptible bacteria. Its use should be reserved for confirmed susceptible organisms or a high probability of infection with susceptible organisms. The list of susceptible bacteria includes Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible), Legionella pneumophila, Haemophilus influenza, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.\"\n",
      "Tazemetostat_(15698),\"Tazemetostat belongs to drug node. Tazemetostat is a methyltransferase inhibitor used to treat metastatic or locally advanced epithelioid sarcoma not eligible for complete resection. Tazemetostat was first named in literature as EPZ-6438. EZH2 is a methyltransferase subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) which catalyzes multiple methylations of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27). Trimethylation of this lysine inhibits the transcription of genes associated with cell cycle arrest. PRC2 is antagonized by the switch/sucrose non-fermentable (SWI/SNF) multiprotein complex. Abnormal activation of EZH2 or loss of function mutations in SWI/SNF lead to hyper-trimethylation of H3K27. Hyper-trimethylation of H3K27 leads to cancer cell de-differentiation, a gain of cancer stem cell-like properties. De-differentiation can allow for cancer cell proliferation. Tazemetostat is 88% protein bound in plasma. Tazemetostat is a methyltransferase inhibitor that prevents hyper-trimethylation of histones and inhibits cancer cell de-differentiation. The duration of action is long as it is given twice daily. Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of secondary maligcies and embryo-fetal toxicity. Tazemetostat is indicated to treat adult and pediatric patients 16 years and older with metastatic or locally advanced epithelioid sarcoma that is not eligible for complete resection.\"\n",

      "Glecaprevir_(15725),\"Glecaprevir belongs to drug node. Glecaprevir is a direct acting antiviral agent and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease inhibitor that targets the the viral RNA replication. In combination with , glecaprevir is a useful therapy for patients who experienced therapeutic failure from other NS3/4A protease inhibitors. It demonstrates a high genetic barrier against resistance mutations of the virus. In cell cultures, the emergence of amino acid substitutions at NS3 resistance-associated positions A156 or D/Q168 in HCV genotype 1a, 2a or 3a replicons led to reduced susceptibility to glecaprevir. The combinations of amino acid substitutions at NS3 position Y65H and D/Q168 also results in greater reductions in glecaprevir susceptibility, and NS3 Q80R in genotype 3a patients also leads to glecaprevir resistance.  Glecaprevir is an inhibitor of the HCV NS3/4A protease, which is a viral enzyme necessary for the proteolytic cleavage of the HCV encoded polyprotein into mature forms of the NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B proteins. These multifunctional proteins, including NS3, are essential for viral replication. The N-terminal of NS3 protein confers serine protease activity, whileThe C-terminus of NS3 encodes a DExH/D-box RNA helicase which hydyolyzes NTP as an energy source to unwind double-stranded RNA in a 3′ to 5′ direction during replication of viral genomic RNA. NS4A is a cofactor for NS3 that directs the localization of NS3 and modulates its enzymatic activities. Glecaprevir disrupts the intracellular processes of the viral life cycle through inhibiting the NS3/4A protease activity of cleaving downstream junctions of HCV polypeptide and proteolytic processing of mature structural proteins.  Pibrentasvir is 97.5% bound to human plasma proteins. The Blood-to-plasma ratio is approximately 0.57. In a biochemical assay studying clinical isolates of HCV genotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 4a, 5a, and 6a, glecaprevir displayed IC50 values ranging from 3.5 to 11.3 nM that resulted in inhibition of the proteolytic activity of recombit NS3/4A enzymes. In HCV replicon assays, glecaprevir had median EC50 values of 0.08-4.6 nM against laboratory and clinical isolates from subtypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 4a, 4d, 5a, and 6a. In a QT study, glecaprevir is not shown to prolong the QTc interval.

Chemically, it is a modified tetrapeptidyl epoxide and an analog of epoxomicin. It is also a selective proteasome inhibitor. FDA approved on July 20, 2012. Carfilzomib is made up of four modified peptides and acts as a proteasome inhibitor. Carfilzomib irreversibly and selectively binds to N-terminal threonine-containing active sites of the 20S proteasome, the proteolytic core particle within the 26S proteasome. This 20S core has 3 catalytic active sites: the chymotrypsin, trypsin, and caspase-like sites. Inhibition of the chymotrypsin-like site by carfilzomib (β5 and β5i subunits) is the most effective target in decreasing cellular proliferation, ultimately resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of cancerous cells. At higher doses, carfilzomib will inhibit the trypsin-and capase-like sites.  Over the concentration range of 0.4 - 4 micromolar, carfilzomib was 97% protein bound.  Intravenous carfilzomib administration resulted in suppression of proteasome chymotrypsin-like activity when measured in blood 1 hour after the first dose. On Day 1 of Cycle 1, proteasome inhibition in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) ranged from 79% to 89% at 15 mg/m2, and from 82% to 83% at 20 mg/m2. In addition, carfilzomib administration resulted in inhibition of the LMP2 and MECL1 subunits of the immunoproteasome ranging from 26% to 32% and 41% to 49%, respectively, at 20 mg/m2. Proteasome inhibition was maintained for ≥ 48 hours following the first dose of carfilzomib for each week of dosing. Resistance against carfilzomib has been observed and although the mechanism has not been confirmed, it is thought that up-regulation of P-glycoprotein may be a contributing factor. Furthermore, studies suggest that carfilzomib is more potent than bortezomib.  Carfilzomib is indicated for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory agent and have demonstrated disease progression on or within 60 days of completion of the last therapy.

It belongs to the family of drugs called farnesyltransferase inhibitors. It is also called Zarnestra. In June 2005, the FDA issued a Not Approvable Letter for Zarnestra. The farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) are a class of experimental cancer drugs that target protein farnesyltransferase with the downstream effect of preventing the proper functioning of the Ras protein, which is commonly abnormally active in cancer. After translation, RAS goes through four steps of modification: isoprenylation, proteolysis, methylation and palmitoylation. Isoprenylation involves the enzyme farnesyltransferase (FTase) transferring a farnesyl group from farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) to the pre-RAS protein. Also, a related enzyme geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTase I) has the ability to transfer a geranylgeranyl group to K and N-RAS. Farnesyl is necessary to attach RAS to the cell membrane. Without attachment to the cell membrane, RAS is not able to transfer signals from membrane receptors (Reuter et al., 2000).  R115777, a nonpeptidomimetic farnesyl transferase inhibitor, suppresses the growth of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines. This growth inhibition is associated with modulation in the phosphorylation levels of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK).

MDP is a motif present in all gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial walls that is recognized by different signalling molecules and activators such as nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) and toll-like receptors present in macrophages and monocytes. The overall result of MDP recognition leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines and promotion of bactericidal and tumoricidal effects. As a liposomal formulation, mifamurtide demonstrates an enhanced tumoricidal effect and improved safety profile. It was discovered that tumor necrosis could be promoted by factors released by the host’s immune system (e.g. macrophages) in response to the endotoxins or bacterial products. Mifamurtide is referred to as MTP-PE or L-MTP-PE (in case of the liposomal formulation), which is a fully synthetic derivative of muramyl dipeptide (MDP), which is a motif within the peptidoglycan polymer in the cell wall of bacteria.   Mifamurtide stimulates the innate immunity by activating monocytes and macrophages. Within hours following administration of mifamurtide in healthy adults or patients with osteosarcoma NOS, elevated plasma levels of proinflammatory molecules, such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β, and other indicators of immune stimulation like C-reactive protein and neopterine were observed. _In vivo_ administration of mifamurtide in rat and mouse model resulted in inhibition of tumour growth of lung metastasis, skin and liver cancer, and fibrosarcoma. In addition, increased disease-free survival rate was demonstrated when mifamurtide was given as an adjuvant in dog models of osteosarcoma and hemangiosarcoma.

The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the CXC chemokine family and is a major mediator of the inflammatory response. The encoded protein is commonly referred to as interleukin-8 (IL-8). IL-8 is secreted by mononuclear macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. It functions as a chemotactic factor by guiding the neutrophils to the site of infection. Bacterial and viral products rapidly induce IL-8 expression. IL-8 also participates with other cytokines in the proinflammatory signaling cascade and plays a role in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). This gene is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the lower respiratory tract infection bronchiolitis, a common respiratory tract disease caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The overproduction of this proinflammatory protein is thought to cause the lung inflammation associated with csytic fibrosis. This proinflammatory protein is also suspected of playing a role in coronary artery disease and endothelial dysfunction. This protein is also secreted by tumor cells and promotes tumor migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. This chemokine is also a potent angiogenic factor. The binding of IL-8 to one of its receptors (IL-8RB/CXCR2) increases the permeability of blood vessels and increasing levels of IL-8 are positively correlated with increased severity of multiple disease outcomes (eg, sepsis).

The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family which plays a fundamental role in pathogen recognition and activation of innate immunity. TLRs are highly conserved from Drosophila to humans and share structural and functional similarities. They recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns that are expressed on infectious agents, and mediate the production of cytokines necessary for the development of effective immunity. The various TLRs exhibit different patterns of expression. In silico studies have found a particularly strong binding of surface TLR4 with the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). This receptor has also been implicated in signal transduction events induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) found in most gram-negative bacteria.

This gene encodes a transcription factor that belongs to the family of zinc-finger DNA-binding proteins associated with chromatin remodeling. The expression of this protein is restricted to the fetal and adult hemo-lymphopoietic system, and it functions as a regulator of lymphocyte differentiation. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene. Most isoforms share a common C-terminal domain, which contains two zinc finger motifs that are required for hetero- or homo-dimerization, and for interactions with other proteins. The isoforms, however, differ in the number of N-terminal zinc finger motifs that bind DNA and in nuclear localization signal presence, resulting in members with and without DNA-binding properties. Only a few isoforms contain the requisite three or more N-terminal zinc motifs that confer high affinity binding to a specific core DNA sequence element in the promoters of target genes. The non-DNA-binding isoforms are largely found in the cytoplasm, and are thought to function as dominant-negative factors. Overexpression of some dominant-negative isoforms have been associated with B-cell malignancies, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). [provided by RefSeq, May 2014].\"\n",

Ivosidenib is now available in the United States under the trade name Tibsovo marketed by Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Ivosidenib has been granted fast track, priority review, and orphan drug designations by the FDA. Ivosidenib is a reversible inhibitor of IDH1 which is non-competitive with respect to the cofactor NADH. It binds to many different 132-substituted IDH1 mutants as well as the wild type enzyme. It is considered to be a slow-binder of the wild type enzyme and binds to mutant enzymes at lower concentrations, both of which may contribute its selectivity. Ivosidenib has not been observed to inhibit any form of IDH2 at micromolar concentrations. Ivosidenib is 92-96% bound to plasma proteins as determined in vitro. Many cancers undergo missense mutations of their IDH1 gene leading to substitution of arginine 132 residue of the IDH1 enzyme. Furthermore, methylation sensitive insulators can no longer regulate the activation of oncogenes when histones are hypermethylated. In AML this hypermethylation is known to disrupt hematopoietic differentiation. Ivosidenib is approved for use in the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML with a susceptible IDH1 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test.\"\n",
      "Larotrectinib_(15745),\"Larotrectinib belongs to drug node. Larotrectinib is an orally administered tropomyosin receptor kinase (Trk) inhibitor with demonstrated antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, larotrectinib binds to Trk, thereby preventing neurotrophin-Trk interaction and Trk activation, which results in both the induction of cellular apoptosis and the inhibition of cell growth in tumors that overexpress Trk. Trk, a receptor tyrosine kinase activated by neurotrophins, is mutated in a variety of cancer cell types and plays an important role in tumor cell growth and survival. Tropomysoin Receptor Kinases (TRK) like TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC elicit activities that regulate the natural growth, differentiation, and survival of neurons when they interact with endogenous neutrotrophin ligands. TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC are themselves encoded by the NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3 genes, respectively. It has been discovered that chromosomal rearrangements involving in-frame fusions of these genes with various partners, translocations in the TRK kinase domains, mutations in the TRK ligand-binding site, amplifications of NTRK, or the expression of TRK splice variants can result in constitutively-activated chimeric TRK fusion proteins that can act as oncogenic drivers that promote cell proliferation and survival in tumor cell lines. Larotrectinib is approximately 70% bound to human plasma proteins in vitro and binding is independent of drug concentrations. The blood to plasma concentration ratio is 0.9. At doses that are nine-fold greater than the recommended adult dose, larotrectinib does not elicit any QTc interval prolongation that is clinically relevant. Larotrectinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is currently indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with solid tumors that either a) have a neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase (NTRK) gene fusion without a known acquired resistance mutation, b) are metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity, and c) have no satisfactory alternative treatments or that have progressed following treatment.\"\n",
      "Vibegron_(15746),\"Vibegron belongs to drug node. Vibegron is a potent, selective beta-3 adrenergic receptor (β3) agonist that relaxes the detrusor smooth muscle of the bladder, thereby increasing bladder capacity. Vibegron was first approved in Japan in September 2018 for the treatment of overactive bladder, a condition associated with distressing symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency, and reduced quality of life of patients. On December 23, 2020, vibegron was approved for the same indication in adults. It is available as oral tablets under the market name GEMTESA.  Overactive bladder is characterized by symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency. Bladder filling and emptying are regulated by the coordinated communication between sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. Bladder filling occurs via parasympathetic inhibition and the sympathetic hypogastric nerve releasing norepinephrine, which acts on beta-adrenergic receptors responsible for mediating detrusor muscle relaxation. Symptoms of overactive bladder are thought to be caused by the deterioration of the sensory connections between the bladder, spinal cord and brain, leading to changes in the lower urinary tract and abnormal bladder sensations of the urge to void at small bladder volumes. Vibegron is 49.6–51.3% bound to human plasma proteins. Vibegron selectivity for beta-3 adrenergic receptors is >9000 times higher than for β1AR or β2AR. Vibegron improves clinical symptoms of overactive bladder by increasing bladder capacity without affecting bladder contraction. It significantly increases the functional bladder volume in a dose-dependent manner, which results in prolongation of the interval between voids. In clinical studies, vibegron inhibited detrusor bladder contractions in a concentration-dependent manner, reduced voiding pressure, and increased bladder compliance. In Japanese clinical studies comprising patients with overactive bladder, vibegron significantly improved the frequency of micturition, urgency, and urgency incontinence episodes. Vibegron is indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency in adults.\"\n",
      "Zanubrutinib_(15748),\"Zanubrutinib belongs to drug node. Zanubrutinib is a novel Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor used for the treatment of adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy. Mantle cell lymphoma is an aggressive mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is associated with early relapse, poor clinical outcomes, and long-term survival. BTK is an enzyme that plays a role in oncogenic signalling pathways, where it promotes the survival and proliferation of maligt B cells. Compared to the first-generation BTK inhibitor , zanubrutinib displays higher potency and selectivity for BTK with fewer off-target effects. Due to this enhanced selectivity towards BTK, zanubrutinib belongs to the second-generation BTK inhibitor drug group that also includes , which was approved by the FDA in 2017. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a non-receptor kinase and a signalling molecule for the B cell receptors expressed on the peripheral B cell surface. The BCR signalling pathway plays a crucial role in normal B-cell development but also the proliferation and survival of maligt B cells in many B cell maligcies, including mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL). Once activated by upstream Src-family kinases, BTK phosphorylates phospholipase-Cγ (PLCγ), leading to Ca2+ mobilization and activation of NF-κB and MAP kinase pathways. These downstream cascades promote the expression of genes involved in B cell proliferation and survival. The BCR signalling pathway also induces the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL and regulates the integrin α4β1 (VLA-4)-mediated adhesion of B cells to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and fibronectin via BTK. Apart from the direct downstream signal transduction pathway of B cells, BTK is also involved in chemokine receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR) and Fc receptor signalling pathways.  The plasma protein binding of zanubrutinib is approximately 94%. Zanubrutinib is an immunomodulating agent that decreases the survival of maligt B cells. It inhibits BTK by binding to its active site. It works to inhibit the proliferation and survival of maligt B cells to reduce the tumour size in mantle cell lymphoma. Zanubrutinib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy.\"\n",
      "Pemigatinib_(15749),\"Pemigatinib belongs to drug node. Pemigatinib is a small molecule kinase inhibitor with antitumour activity. It works by inhibiting fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), which are receptor tyrosine kinases that activate signalling pathways in tumour cells. FGFRs gained attention as potential therapeutic targets in selected cancers, as FGFR gene alterations were observed in a wide variety of cancers including those of the urinary bladder, breast, ovary, prostate, endometrium, lung, and stomach. Deregulated FGFR signalling pathway can lead the development of oncogenes and tumour-promoting physiological processes, such as cancer cell proliferation, enhanced angiogenesis, and evasion of cell death. Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in activating signalling pathways that promote cell proliferation, survival, and migration, as well as growth arrest and cellular differentiation. The initiation of the FGFR signalling pathway requires the binding of its natural ligand, fibroblast growth factor (FGF). Once FGF binds to the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the receptor, FGFRs dimerize and autophosphorylate the tyrosine residue in the intracellular tyrosine-kinase domain, leading to the activation of the tyrosine kinase. Downstream cascades involve phosphorylation of multiple intracellular signalling proteins, such as phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)-AKT and RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and phospholipase Cγ, which activates the protein kinase C pathway. FGFR-mediated pathway ultimately promotes cell growth, differentiation, survival, angiogenesis, and organogenesis, depending on cell type. Expressed in different isoforms in various tissues and cell lines, FGFRs are not constitutively active in normal cells. However, FGFR1, FGFR2, or FGFR3 alterations in certain tumours can lead to constitutive FGFR activation and aberrant FGFR signalling, supporting the proliferation and survival of maligt cells. The _in vitro_ serum protein binding of pemigatinib was 90.6% at drug concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 µM. Pemigatinib is a small molecule kinase inhibitor that exerts anti-tumour activity through inhibition of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs). With an IC<sub>50</sub> of less than 2 nM, pemigatinib displays potent inhibition of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3. In mouse xenograft models of human tumours with FGFR1, FGFR2, or FGFR3 alterations, pemigatinib exhibited potent anti-tumour activity by suppressing the growth of xenografted tumour models. It also showed efficacy against a patient-derived xenograft model of cholangiocarcinoma that expressed an oncogenic FGFR2­ Transformer-2 beta homolog (TRA2b) fusion protein. Pemigatinib also inhibited FGFR4 _in vitro_, however at a concentration approximately 100 times higher than those that inhibit FGFR1, 2, and 3. Pemigatinib is indicated for the treatment of unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma in previously-treated adult patients with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusion or other rearrangement as detected by an FDA-approved test.\"\n",
      "Avapritinib_(15750),\"Avapritinib belongs to drug node. Avapritinib, or BLU-285, is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of KIT and platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha indicated for the treatment of unresectable, metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors. It is one of the first medications available for the treatment of multidrug resistant cancers. Avapritinib shares a similar mechanism with. Avapritinib has a negative modulating effect on the transporters ABCB1 and ABCG2, which mediate the multidrug resistance phenotype of some cancers. This modulation may be due to interactions of avapritinib with the drug binding pocket of these transporters. Negative modulation of these transporters, resensitizes cancerous cells to treatment with chemotherapeutic agents like. Avapritinib is 98.8% protein bound in serum. Avapritinib is a selective kinase inhibitor that negatively modulates the action of cell transporters to resensitize them to other chemotherapies. It has a long duration of action as it is given once daily. Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of intracranial hemorrhage, CNS effects, and embryo-fetal toxicity.

      "Selpercatinib_(15752),\"Selpercatinib belongs to drug node. Selpercatinib is a kinase inhibitor with enhanced specificity for RET tyrosine kinase receptors (RTKs) over other RTK classes. Enhanced RET (Rearranged during transfection) oncogene expression is a hallmark of many cancers. Although multikinase inhibitors, including , , , , and , have shown efficacy in RET-driven cancers, their lack of specificity is generally associated with substantial toxicity. Selpercatinib (LOXO-292) and pralsetinib (BLU-667) represent the first generation of specific RET RTK inhibitors for the treatment of RET-driven cancers. Rearranged during transfection (RET) is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase containing extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular domains whose activity is required for normal kidney and nervous system development. Constitutive RET activation is primarily achieved through chromosomal rearrangements producing 5' fusions of dimerizable domains to the 3' _RET_ tyrosine kinase domain, such as _KIF5B-RET_ and _CCDC6-RET_, resulting in constitutive dimerization and subsequent autophosphorylation. Constitutive activation leads to increased downstream signalling and is associated with tumour invasion, migration, and proliferation. Selpercatinib displays 97% _in vitro_ protein binding independent of concentration and a blood-plasma concentration ratio of 0.7. Selpercatinib exerts anti-tumour activity in specific cancers through inhibition of mutated forms of RET tyrosine kinases. Due to its increased specificity for RET over other tyrosine kinases, selpercatinib is thought to have an improved safety profile compared to other multi-kinase inhibitors. Despite this, selpercatinib treatment is associated with hepatotoxicity, hypertension, QT interval prolongation, hemorrhagic events, risk of impaired wound healing, and embryo-fetal toxicity; some patients may also exhibit hypersensitivity to selpercatinib. Selpercatinib is indicated for the treatment of _RET_ fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer in adult patients. Selpercatinib is also indicated for the systemic treatment of advanced or metastatic _RET_-mutant medullary thyroid cancer and for the systemic treatment of _RET_ fusion-positive radioactive iodine-refractory thyroid cancer in both adult and pediatric patients aged 12 and over.\"\n",
      "Benzocaine_(15763),\"Benzocaine belongs to drug node. A surface anesthetic that acts by preventing transmission of impulses along nerve fibers and at nerve endings.

      "Filgotinib_(15768),\"Filgotinib belongs to drug node. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune, systemic, and inflammatory disease that causes synovial joint symptoms and can limit range of motion in severe cases. The disease is associated with extra-articular manifestations, progressive disability, and comorbidities including cardiovascular disease and mental disorders. 50-70% of patients with RA are unable to achieve sustained clinical remission despite the availability of several treatments including disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDS) like , interleukin-6 (IL-6) blockers, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. New therapeutic developments target other inflammatory pathways implicated in RA including the Janus kinase (JAK) signaling pathway as seen with filgotinib.  There are four Janus kinase (JAK) enzymes including JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and tyrosine kinase 2. JAK1 mediates inflammatory cytokine signaling, while JAK2 and JAK3 are important components of hematologic and immune functions. Filgotinib selectively inhibits JAK1 and is for example nearly 30-fold more selective for JAK1 compared to JAK2.  Approximately 55-59% of filgotinib is protein-bound, while 39-44% of the active metabolite GS-829845 is protein-bound.  In addition to targeted Janus kinase (JAK) 1 inhibition, filgotinib targets pro-inflammatory cytokine signalling by inhibiting IL-6 induced STAT1 phosphorylation. Serum C-reactive protein levels are also reduced in response to filgotinib administration. Filgotinib is indicated for the treatment of active moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis alone or in combination with methotrexate. Filgotinib is currently reserved for patients who are unable to tolerate or who have not responded adequately to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDS).\"\n",
      "Acetylsalicylic acid_(15781),\"Acetylsalicylic acid belongs to drug node. Also known as _Aspirin_, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is a commonly used drug for the treatment of pain and fever due to various causes. Acetylsalicylic acid has both anti-inflammatory and antipyretic effects. This drug also inhibits platelet aggregation and is used in the prevention of blood clots stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI).  Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) blocks prostaglandin synthesis. It is non-selective for COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. Inhibition of COX-1 results in the inhibition of platelet aggregation for about 7-10 days (average platelet lifespan). The acetyl group of acetylsalicylic acid binds with a serine residue of the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) enzyme, leading to irreversible inhibition. This prevents the production of pain-causing prostaglandins. This process also stops the conversion of arachidonic acid to thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which is a potent inducer of platelet aggregation. Platelet aggregation can result in clots and harmful venous and arterial thromboembolism, leading to conditions such as pulmonary embolism and stroke.  50% to 90% of a normal therapeutic concentration salicylate (a main metabolite of acetylsalicylic acid ) binds plasma proteins, particularly albumin, while acetylsalicylic acid itself binds negligibly. Acetylsalicylic acid has the ability to bind to and acetylate many proteins, hormones, DNA, platelets, and hemoglobin. **Effects on pain and fever** **Pain, fever, and inflammation**\"\n",
      "Doconexent_(15786),\"Doconexent belongs to drug node. A mixture of fish oil and primrose oil, doconexent is used as a high-docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplement. DHA is a 22 carbon chain with 6 cis double bonds with anti-inflammatory effects. It can be biosythesized from alpha-linolenic acid or commercially manufactured from microalgae. It is an omega-3 fatty acid and primary structural component of the human brain, cerebral cortex, skin, and retina thus plays an important role in their development and function. The amino-phospholipid DHA is found at a high concentration across several brain subcellular fractions, including nerve terminals, microsomes, synaptic vesicles, and synaptosomal plasma membranes. DHA and its conversion to other lipid signalling moleccules compete with the arachidonic acid cascade from endogenous phospholipids and shift the inflammatory state to being more anti-inflammatory. DHA inhibits endotoxin-stimulated production of IL-6 and IL-8 in human endothelial cells. Derivatives of DHA are anti-inflammatory lipid mediators. Lipid mediators resolvin D1 and protectin D1 all inhibit transendothelial migration of neutrophils, so preventing neutrophilic infiltration at sites of inflammation, resolvin D1 inhibits IL-1β production, and protectin D1 inhibits TNF and IL-1β production. Monoxydroxy derivative of DHA converted by LOX inhibit thromboxane-induced platelet aggregation. DHA supplementation has also shown to reduce the levels of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and other circulating markers of inflammation such as neutrophils in hypertriglyceridemic men.   DHA in the central nervous system is found in the phospholipid bilayers where it modulates the physical environment and increase the free volume within the membrane bilayer. It influences the G-protein coupled receptor activity and affects transmembrane transport and cell interaction with the exterior world. It is also reported to promote apoptosis, neuronal differentiation and ion channel activity. Like other polyunsaturated fatty acids, DHA acts as a ligand at PPARs that plays an anti-inflammatory effect and regulate inflammatory gene expression and NFκB activation. DHA also gives rise to resolvins and related compounds (e.g., protectins) through pathways involving cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes to resolve the inflammatory responses.

Ombitasvir is a direct acting antiviral medication used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as Ombitasvir. Ombitasvir is an inhibitor of NS5A, a protein essential for viral replication and virion assembly. The barrier for develoment of resistance to NS5A inhibitors is lower than that of NS5B inhibitors, another class of DAAs.  Ombitasvir is an inhibitor of the HCV non-structural protein 5A. While the precise role of this protein is unknown, it is essential to viral replication and virion assembly. Potential modes of action of NS5A inhibitors like Elbasvir include blocking signaling interactions, redistribution of NS5A from the endoplasmic reticulum to the surface of lipid droplets, and modification of the HCV replication complex.

      "Memantine_(15818),\"Memantine belongs to drug node. Initially approved by the FDA in 2013, memantine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist used in the management of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). It is different from many other Alzheimer's Disease medications, as it works by a different mechanism than the cholinesterase enzyme inhibitors normally employed in the management of Alzheimer's disease. Memantine blocks the effects of glutamate, a neurotransmitter in the brain that leads to neuronal excitability and excessive stimulation in Alzheimer's Disease. Continuous activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the central nervous system caused by _glutamate_ is thought to cause some of the Alzheimer's disease symptoms. This overactivation is thought to contribute to neurotoxicity due to the excitatory properties of glutamate. The pharmacological effect of memantine likely occurs via the drug's behavior as an uncompetitive (open-channel) NMDA receptor antagonist, preventing glutamate action on this receptor. Memantine has a preference for the NMDA receptor-operated cation channels. Despite these antagonist effects, memantine has not been proven to prevent or retard the neurodegeneration seen in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. The protein binding for memantine is about 45%.  **General effects** Memantine is used to manage moderate to severe Alzheimer's dementia. \"\n",
      "Ursodeoxycholic acid_(15822),\"Ursodeoxycholic acid belongs to drug node. Ursodeoxycholic acid is an epimer of. It is a mammalian bile acid found first in the bear and is apparently either a precursor or a product of chenodeoxycholate. Its administration changes the composition of bile and may dissolve gallstones. It is used as a cholagogue and choleretic. Ursodeoxycholic acid reduces elevated liver enzyme levels by facilitating bile flow through the liver and protecting liver cells.  Ursodiol (commonly known as ursodeoxycholic acid) is a product of metabolism of bacteria in the intestine. It is considered a secondary bile acid. The other type of bile acid, primary bile acids, are produced hepatically and subsequently stored in the gallbladder. When primary bile acids are secreted into the large intestine, they can be broken down into secondary bile acids by bacteria present in the intestine. Both types of bile acids assist in the metabolism of dietary fat. Ursodeoxycholic acid regulates cholesterol levels by slowing the rate at which the intestine is able to absorb cholesterol and also acts to break down micelles, which contain cholesterol. Because of this property, ursodeoxycholic acid is used to treat gall stones non-surgically. The drug decreases the absorption of cholesterol and is used to dissolve (cholesterol) gallstones in patients as an alternative to a surgical procedure to remove the gallstones.\"\n",
      "Fingolimod_(15829),\"Fingolimod belongs to drug node. Multiple sclerosis or MS is a devastating inflammatory disease that often progresses and causes severe neurological, physical, and cognitive effects. Fingolimod is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. It was developed by Novartis and initially approved by the FDA in 2010. Sphingosine‐1‐phosphate (S1P) is an important phospholipid that binds to various G‐protein‐coupled receptor subtypes, which can be identified as S1P1–5R. S1P and the receptors it binds to perform regular functions in the immune, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and nervous system. S1P can be expressed ubiquitously, playing an important role in regulating inflammation. S1P1R, S1P2R, and S1P3R receptors can be found in the cardiovascular, immune, and central nervous systems. S1P4R is found on lymphocytic and hematopoietic cells, while S1P5R expression is found only on the spleen (on natural killer cells) or in the central nervous system. The protein binding of fingolimod and its active metabolite exceeds 99.7%. In multiple sclerosis, fingolimod binds to sphingosine receptors, reducing its associated neuroinflammation.In COVID-19, it may reduce lung inflammation and improve the clinical outcomes of patients with this disease.  Fingolimod is indicated for the treatment of patients aged 10 and above with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, which may include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, as well as active secondary progressive disease.\"\n",
      "Lopinavir_(14346),\"Lopinavir belongs to drug node. Lopinavir is an antiretroviral protease inhibitor used in combination with other antiretrovirals in the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Lopinavir is marketed and administered exclusively in combination with - this combination, first marketed by Abbott under the brand name Kaletra in 2000, is necessary due to lopinavir's poor oral bioavailability and extensive biotransformation. Ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of the enzymes responsible for lopinavir metabolism, and its co-administration \\boosts\\\"\" lopinavir exposure and improves antiviral activity. Like many other protease inhibitors (e.g. , ), lopinavir is a peptidomimetic molecule - it contains a hydroxyethylene scaffold that mimics the peptide linkage typically targeted by the HIV-1 protease enzyme but which itself cannot be cleaved, thus preventing the activity of the HIV-1 protease.\"\" The HIV lifecycle is comprised of 3 distinct stages: assembly, involving creation and packaging of essential viral components; budding, wherein the viral particle crosses the host cell plasma membrane and forms a lipid envelope; and maturation, wherein the viral particle alters its structure and becomes infectious. At the center of this lifecycle is the Gag polyprotein which, along with the products of its proteolysis, coordinate these stages and function as the major structural proteins of the virus. The HIV-1 protease enzyme, a dimeric aspartic protease, is the enzyme responsible for cleaving the Gag polyprotein and thus plays a critical role in many aspects of the HIV viral lifecycle. Lopinavir is >98% protein-bound in plasma. It binds to both alpha-1-acid glycoprotein and albumin, but exhibits a greater affinity for alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Lopinavir inhibits the activity of an enzyme critical for the HIV viral lifecycle. It has a moderate duration of action necessitating once or twice daily dosing. Lopinavir, like other protease inhibitors, has a propensity for participating in drug interactions - use caution when administering lopinavir to patients maintained on other pharmaceutical agents as pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions are common. Fatal hepatotoxicity and pancreatitis have been noted in patients undergoing therapy with lopinavir and patients with an increased baseline risk of these events should be monitored closely throughout therapy. The combination product lopinavir/ritonavir, marketed under the brand name Kaletra, is indicated in combination with other antiretrovirals for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and pediatric patients ≥14 days old.\"\n",
      "Hydroxychloroquine_(14347),\"Hydroxychloroquine belongs to drug node. Hydroxychloroquine is a racemic mixture consisting of an R and S etiomer. Hydroxychloroquine is an aminoquinoline like. It is a commonly prescribed medication in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic discoid lupus erythematosus, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Hydroxychloroquine is also used for the prophylaxis of malaria in regions where chloroquine resistance is unlikely. It was developed during World War II as a derivative of with less severe side effects. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are both being investigated for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. The exact mechanisms of hydroxychloroquine are unknown. It has been shown that hydroxychloroquine accumulates in the lysosomes of the malaria parasite, raising the pH of the vacuole. This activity interferes with the parasite's ability to proteolyse hemoglobin, preventing the normal growth and replication of the parasite. Hydroxychloroquine can also interfere with the action of parasitic heme polymerase, allowing for the accumulation of the toxic product beta-hematin. The S etiomer of hydroxychloroquine is 64% protein bound in plasma. It is 50% bound to serum albumin and 29% bound to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. The R etiomer is 37% protein bound in plasma. It is 29% bound to serum albumin and 41% bound to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. In total, hydroxychloroquine is 50% protein bound in plasma. Hydroxychloroquine affects the function of lysozomes in humans as well as plasmodia. Altering the pH of the lysozomes reduces low affinity self antigen presentation in autoimmue diseases and interferes with the ability of plasmodia to proteolyse hemoglobin for their energy requirements. Hydroxychloroquine has a long duration of action as it may be taken on a weekly basis for some indications. Hydroxychloroquine may lead to severe hypoglycemia and so diabetic patients are advised to monitor their blood glucose levels. Hydroxychloroquine is not effective against malaria in areas where chloroquine resistance has been reported. Hydroxychloroquine is indicated for the prophylaxis of malaria where chloroquine resistance is not reported, treatment of uncomplicated malaria (caused by _P. falciparum_, _P. malariae_, _P. ovale_, or _P. vivax_), chronic discoid lupus erythematosus, systemic lupus erythematosus, acute rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic rheumatoid arthritis.\"\n",

      "Dronedarone_(14368),\"Dronedarone belongs to drug node. Dronedarone is a Class III antiarrhythmic drug that works to restore the normal sinus rhythm in patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is a common sustained arrhythmia where the treatment primarily focuses on stroke prevention and symptom management. It is managed by rate control, rhythm control, prevention of thromboembolic events, and treatment of the underlying disease. Similar to , dronedarone is a multichannel blocker that works to control rhythm and rate in atrial fibrillation. It meets criteria of all four Vaughan Williams antiarrhythmic drug classes by blocking sodium, potassium, and calcium ion channels and inhibiting β-adrenergic receptors.  Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of arrhythmia that is caused by abnormal electrical activity in the atria. In atrial fibrillation, tachyarrhythmia, or fast heart rate, can either be paroxysmal (less than 7 days) or persistent (more than 7 days). Atrial fibrillation causes turbulent and abnormal blood flow through the heart chambers, leading to decreased the effectiveness of the heart to pump blood and an increased likelihood of thrombus formation within the atria which can ultimately dislodge and cause a stroke.  The _in vitro_ plasma protein binding of dronedarone and its N-debutyl metabolite is 99.7% and 98.5%, respectively. Both mainly bind to albumin and are not capable of saturation. Dronedarone is an antiarrhythmic agent that restores normal sinus rhythm and reduces heart rate in atrial fibrillation. In another model, it prevents ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. Dronedarone moderately prolongs the QTc interval by about 10 ms on average. Dronedarone decreases arterial blood pressure and reduces oxygen consumption. It reduces myocardial contractility with no change in left ventricular ejection fraction. Dronedarone vasodilates coronary arteries through activation of the nitric oxide pathway. In clinical studies, dronedarone reduced incidence of hospitalizations for acute coronary syndromes and reduced incidence of stroke. Dronedarone exhibits antiadrenergic effects by reducing alpha-adrenergic blood pressure response to epinephrine and beta 1 and beta 2 responses to isoproterenol.  Dronedarone is indicated for the management of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients in sinus rhythm with a history of paroxysmal or persistent AF to reduce the risk of hospitalization.\"\n",

      "Telaprevir_(14375),\"Telaprevir belongs to drug node. Telaprevir is a direct acting antiviral medication used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as Telaprevir. Telaprevir is an inhibitor of NS3/4A, a serine protease enzyme, encoded by HCV genotype 1. These enzymes are essential for viral replication and serve to cleave the virally encoded polyprotein into mature proteins like NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B. The barrier for develoment of resistance to NS3/4A inhibitors is lower than that of NS5B inhibitors, another class of DAAs. Subtitutions at amino acid positions 155, 156, or 168 are known to confer resistance. The substitutions of the enzyme's catalytic triad consisting of H58, D82, and S139 are also likely to alter the affinity of the drug for NS3/4A or the activity of the enzyme itself. Despite this disadvantage Telaprevir is still effective against HCV when paired with , , and. Telaprevir is a NS3/4a protease inhibitor used to inhibit viral HCV replication. NS3/4a protease is an integral part of viral replication and mediates the cleavage the virally encoded polyprotein to mature proteins (NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B). Telaprevir inhibits NS3/4A with an IC50 of 10nM. Telapravir is 59-76% bound to human plasma proteins following a single dose. It binds to both human serum albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein. Telaprevir is classified as a direct-acting antiviral (DAA) and prevents viral replication in HCV genotype 1.  Telaprevir, when used in combination with , , and is indicated for use in the treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1 infection in adults.\"\n",
      "Simeprevir_(14382),\"Simeprevir belongs to drug node. Simeprevir is a hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease inhibitor indicated in patient's with HCV genotype 1 for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients. Like all NS3/4A inhibitors, simeprevir is a serine protease inhibitor in similarity to and but is classified as a second generation protease inhibitor. This class of antiviral drugs were the first direct acting antivirals approved but are associated with lower cure rates than newer drugs. Broad use of simeprevir occurred when it was used in combination with a newer drug,. Inhibiting HCV NS3/4A protease in a potent and highly specific manner, simeprevir is a direct-acting antiviral agent against the hepatitis C virus. Since the viral protease NS3/4A complex is essential for cleaving the HCV encoded polyprotein into individual viral proteins facilitating replication , the drug blocks the viral replication process. It is shown to display synergistic effects with interferon-α and HCV NS5B inhibitor, and additive effects with ribavirin in HCV replicon cells. Unlike first generation serine protease inhibitors, simprevir has a sightly different resistance profile where limited therapeutic efficacy of the drug is observed with NS3 Q80K polymorphic variants and simeprevir-specific amino acid position of 168 also results in higher treatment failure rates. The observed prevalence of the N3 Q80K polymorphism was 30% in subjects infected with HCV genotype 1a and 0.5% in subjects infected with HCV genotype 1b.  Simeprevir is accumulated in the liver after uptake into hepatocytes via OATP1B1/3. NS3/4A heterodimeric complex is composed of the cofactor N4A subunit and N3 subunit which contains the proteolytic site. The NS3/4A protease cleaves the HCV polyprotein downstream of the NS3 site, generating non-structural viral proteins NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5A and subsequently formation of mature proteins. Simeprevir exerts an inhibitory action on HCV polyprotein cleavage via induced-fit binding to an extended S2 subsite located in the NS3 catalytic site. NS3/4A inhibitors usually depend on few interactions located in the substrate binding groove of the viral serine protease, thus are susceptible to resistance and failed treatment from few critical mutations in these sites.  Simeprevir is extensively (99.9%) bound to plasma proteins, mainly to albumin and to a lesser extent, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. Increased plasma concentration due to drug-drug interactions is expected when co-administering moderate or strong inhibitors of CYP3A, while the opposite effect is predicted from co-administration of moderate or strong inducers of CYP3A.  Simeprevir is a direct-acting antiviral agent and inhibitor for HCV NS3/4A protease, which is an important enzyme required for viral replication. Unlike and , simeprevir is a competitive, reversible, macrocyclic, noncovalent inhibitor. The macromolecular cyclic portion of the molecule improves the affnity and selectivity characteristics, which allows rapid association and slow dissociation to the protein target through noncovalent binding.  Indicated for the treatment of adults with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection: typically in combination with sofosbuvir in patients with HCV genotype 1 without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis and in combination with peginterferon alfa (Peg-IFN-alfa) and ribavirin (RBV) in patients with HCV genotype 1 or 4 without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis. \"\n",

The high selectivity of prucalopride allowed further development as it prevented the cardiac adverse reactions observed due to non-target effects of precedent therapies. Prucalopride was developed by Shire Development LLC and approved for use in Europe in 2009, in Canada on December 7, 2011 and by the FDA on December 17, 2018. Prucalopride acts as a selective stimulator of the 5-HT4 receptors while having no interaction with hERG channel or 5-HT1 receptors which reduces significantly the cardiovascular risk found in other similar drugs. The plasma protein binding of prucalopride is of 30%. In animal studies, prucalopride induced a dose-dependent stimulation of contractile activity in the proximal colon and inhibition of the contractility in the distal colon. As well it has been shown that prucalopride stimulates and amplifies giant migratory contraction which is the high-amplitude type of contraction that initiates the urge to defecate. Thus, prucalopride not only accelerates the colonic transit but also accelerates gastric emptying and small bowel transit.

      "LAMB1_(2749),\"LAMB1 belongs to gene/protein node. LAMB1 is laminin subunit beta 1. Laminins, a family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins, are the major noncollagenous constituent of basement membranes. They have been implicated in a wide variety of biological processes including cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, signaling, neurite outgrowth and metastasis. Laminins are composed of 3 non identical chains: laminin alpha, beta and gamma (formerly A, B1, and B2, respectively) and they form a cruciform structure consisting of 3 short arms, each formed by a different chain, and a long arm composed of all 3 chains. Each laminin chain is a multidomain protein encoded by a distinct gene. Several isoforms of each chain have been described. Different alpha, beta and gamma chain isomers combine to give rise to different heterotrimeric laminin isoforms which are designated by Arabic numerals in the order of their discovery, i.e. alpha1beta1gamma1 heterotrimer is laminin 1. The biological functions of the different chains and trimer molecules are largely unknown, but some of the chains have been shown to differ with respect to their tissue distribution, presumably reflecting diverse functions in vivo. This gene encodes the beta chain isoform laminin, beta 1. The beta 1 chain has 7 structurally distinct domains which it shares with other beta chain isomers. The C-terminal helical region containing domains I and II are separated by domain alpha, domains III and V contain several EGF-like repeats, and domains IV and VI have a globular conformation. Laminin, beta 1 is expressed in most tissues that produce basement membranes, and is one of the 3 chains constituting laminin 1, the first laminin isolated from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) tumor. A sequence in the beta 1 chain that is involved in cell attachment, chemotaxis, and binding to the laminin receptor was identified and shown to have the capacity to inhibit metastasis.

      "TGFB1_(2889),\"TGFB1 belongs to gene/protein node. TGFB1 is transforming growth factor beta 1. This gene encodes a secreted ligand of the TGF-beta (transforming growth factor-beta) superfamily of proteins. Ligands of this family bind various TGF-beta receptors leading to recruitment and activation of SMAD family transcription factors that regulate gene expression. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate a latency-associated peptide (LAP) and a mature peptide, and is found in either a latent form composed of a mature peptide homodimer, a LAP homodimer, and a latent TGF-beta binding protein, or in an active form consisting solely of the mature peptide homodimer. The mature peptide may also form heterodimers with other TGFB family members. This encoded protein regulates cell proliferation, differentiation and growth, and can modulate expression and activation of other growth factors including interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha.

A gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic inflammation involving all layers of the intestinal wall, noncaseating granulomas affecting the intestinal wall and regional lymph nodes, and transmural fibrosis. Crohn disease most commonly involves the terminal ileum; the colon is the second most common site of involvement. In Crohn's disease, any part of your small or large intestine can be involved, and it may be continuous or may involve multiple segments. In some people, the disease is confined to the colon, which is part of the large intestine. Signs and symptoms of Crohn's disease can range from mild to severe. They usually develop gradually, but sometimes will come on suddenly, without warning. You may also have periods of time when you have no signs or symptoms . When the disease is active, signs and symptoms may include: Diarrhea, Fever, Fatigue, Abdominal pain and cramping, Blood in your stool, Mouth sores, Reduced appetite and weight loss, Pain or drainage near or around the anus due to inflammation from a tunnel into the skin, Other signs and symptoms, People with severe Crohn's disease may also experience: Inflammation of skin, eyes and joints, Inflammation of the liver or bile ducts, Kidney stones, Iron deficiency, Delayed growth or sexual development, in children The exact cause of Crohn's disease remains unknown. Previously, diet and stress were suspected, but now doctors know that these factors may aggravate, but don't cause, Crohn's disease. Several factors, such as heredity and a malfunctioning immune system, likely play a role in its development. Immune system. It's possible that a virus or bacterium may trigger Crohn's disease; however, scientists have yet to identify such a trigger. When your immune system tries to fight off the invading microorganism, an abnormal immune response causes the immune system to attack the cells in the digestive tract, too. Heredity. Crohn's is more common in people who have family members with the disease, so genes may play a role in making people more susceptible. However, most people with Crohn's disease don't have a family history of the disease.\"\n",

Ulcerative colitis symptoms can vary, depending on the severity of inflammation and where it occurs. Signs and symptoms may include: Diarrhea, often with blood or pus, Abdominal pain and cramping, Rectal pain, Rectal bleeding — passing small amount of blood with stool, Urgency to defecate, Inability to defecate despite urgency, Weight loss, Fatigue, Fever, In children, failure to grow, Most people with ulcerative colitis have mild to moderate symptoms. The course of ulcerative colitis may vary, with some people having long periods of remission. Types, Doctors often classify ulcerative colitis according to its location. Types of ulcerative colitis include: Ulcerative proctitis. Inflammation is confined to the area closest to the anus, and rectal bleeding may be the only sign of the disease. Proctosigmoiditis. Inflammation involves the rectum and sigmoid colon — the lower end of the colon. Signs and symptoms include bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramps and pain, and an inability to move the bowels in spite of the urge to do so . Left-sided colitis. Inflammation extends from the rectum up through the sigmoid and descending colon. Signs and symptoms include bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping and pain on the left side, and urgency to defecate. Pancolitis. This type often affects the entire colon and causes bouts of bloody diarrhea that may be severe, abdominal cramps and pain, fatigue, and significant weight loss. The exact cause of ulcerative colitis remains unknown. Previously, diet and stress were suspected, but now doctors know that these factors may aggravate but don't cause ulcerative colitis. One possible cause is an immune system malfunction. When your immune system tries to fight off an invading virus or bacterium, an abnormal immune response causes the immune system to attack the cells in the digestive tract, too. Heredity also seems to play a role in that ulcerative colitis is more common in people who have family members with the disease.

      "Loratadine_(14950),\"Loratadine belongs to drug node. Loratadine is a second generation antihistamine used to manage symptoms of allergic rhinitis. A lack of sedative and CNS adverse effects make loratadine, along with other second generation antihistamines, preferable over their 1st generation counterparts in many clinical situations. Histamine release is a key mediator in allergic rhinitis and urticaria. As a result, loratadine exerts it's effect by targeting H1 histamine receptors. 97 - 99% of the loratadine is bound to plasma proteins. Like other 2nd generation antihistamines, loratadine is selective for peripheral H1 receptors. Loratadine does not penetrate effectively into the central nervous system and has poor affinity for CNS H1-receptors. These qualities result in a lack of CNS depressant effects such as drowsiness, sedation, and impaired psychomotor function. Loratadine is a 2nd generation antihistamine and is used to manage symptoms of allergic rhinitis, wheal formation, urticaria, and other allergic dermatologic conditions. \"\n",
      "Quinine_(14951),\"Quinine belongs to drug node. An alkaloid derived from the bark of the cinchona tree. It is used as an antimalarial drug, and is the active ingredient in extracts of the cinchona that have been used for that purpose since before 1633. Quinine is also a mild antipyretic and analgesic and has been used in common cold preparations for that purpose. It was used commonly and as a bitter and flavoring agent, and is still useful for the treatment of babesiosis. Quinine is also useful in some muscular disorders, especially nocturnal leg cramps and myotonia congenita, because of its direct effects on muscle membrane and sodium channels. The mechanisms of its antimalarial effects are not well understood. The theorized mechanism of action for quinine and related anti-malarial drugs is that these drugs are toxic to the malaria parasite. Specifically, the drugs interfere with the parasite's ability to break down and digest hemoglobin. Consequently, the parasite starves and/or builds up toxic levels of partially degraded hemoglobin in itself.  Approximately 70% Quinine is used parenterally to treat life-threatening infections caused by chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Quinine acts as a blood schizonticide although it also has gametocytocidal activity against P. vivax and P. malariae. Because it is a weak base, it is concentrated in the food vacuoles of P. falciparum. It is thought to act by inhibiting heme polymerase, thereby allowing accumulation of its cytotoxic substrate, heme. As a schizonticidal drug, it is less effective and more toxic than chloroquine. However, it has a special place in the management of severe falciparum malaria in areas with known resistance to chloroquine. For the treatment of malaria and leg cramps\"\n",
      "Haloperidol_(14952),\"Haloperidol belongs to drug node. Haloperidol is a high potency first-generation (typical) antipsychotic and one of the most frequently used antipsychotic medications used worldwide. While haloperidol has demonstrated pharmacologic activity at a number of receptors in the brain, it exerts its antipsychotic effect through its strong antagonism of the dopamine receptor (mainly D2), particularly within the mesolimbic and mesocortical systems of the brain. Haloperidol is indicated for the treatment of the manifestations of several psychotic disorders including schizophrenia, acute psychosis, Tourette syndrome, and other severe behavioural states. It is also used off-label for the management of chorea associated with Huntington's disease and for the treatment of intractable hiccups as it is a potent antiemetic. Dopamine-antagonizing medications such as haloperidol are though to improve psychotic symptoms and states that are caused by an over-production of dopamine, such as schizophrenia, which is theorized to be caused by a hyperdopaminergic state within the limbic system of the brain. While haloperidol has demonstrated pharmacologic activity at a number of receptors in the brain, it exerts its antipsychotic effect through its strong antagonism of the dopamine receptor (mainly D2), particularly within the mesolimbic and mesocortical systems of the brain. Schizophrenia is theorized to be caused by a hyperdopaminergic state within the limbic system of the brain. Dopamine-antagonizing medications such as haloperidol, therefore, are thought to improve psychotic symptoms by halting this over-production of dopamine. The optimal clinical efficacy of antipsychotics is associated with the blockade of approximately 60 % - 80 % of D2 receptors in the brain. Studies have found that free fraction of haloperidol in human plasma is 7.5-11.6%. This was found to be comparable among healthy adults, young adults, elderly patients with schizophrenia, and even in patients with liver cirrhosis. Use of the first-generation antipsychotics (including haloperidol) is considered highly effective for the management of the \\positive\\\"\" symptoms of schizophrenia including hallucinations, hearing voices, aggression/hostility, disorganized speech, and psychomotor agitation. However, this class is limited by the development of movement disorders such as drug-induced parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, and tardive dyskinesia, and other side effects including sedation, weight gain, and prolactin changes. Compared to the lower-potency first-generation antipsychotics such as , , , and , haloperidol typically demonstrates the least amount of side effects within class, but demonstrates a stronger disposition for causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Low‐potency medications have a lower affinity for dopamine receptors so that a higher dose is required to effectively treat symptoms of schizophrenia. In addition, they block many receptors other than the primary target (dopamine receptors), such as cholinergic or histaminergic receptors, resulting in a higher incidence of side effects such as sedation, weight gain, and hypotension.\"\" Haloperidol is indicated for a number of conditions including for the treatment of schizophrenia, for the manifestations of psychotic disorders, for the control of tics and vocal utterances of Tourette’s Disorder in children and adults, for treatment of severe behavior problems in children of combative, explosive hyperexcitability (which cannot be accounted for by immediate provocation). Haloperidol is also indicated in the short-term treatment of hyperactive children who show excessive motor activity with accompanying conduct disorders consisting of some or all of the following symptoms: impulsivity, difficulty sustaining attention, aggressivity, mood lability, and poor frustration tolerance. Haloperidol should be reserved for these two groups of children only after failure to respond to psychotherapy or medications other than antipsychotics.\"\n",
      "Vincristine_(14955),\"Vincristine belongs to drug node. Vincristine is an antitumor vinca alkaloid isolated from Vinca Rosea. It is marketed under several brand names, many of which have different formulations such as Marqibo (liposomal injection) and Vincasar. Vincristine is indicated for the treatment of acute leukaemia, maligt lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, acute erythraemia, and acute panmyelosis. vincristine sulfate is often chosen as part of polychemotherapy because of lack of significant bone–marrow suppression (at recommended doses) and of unique clinical toxicity (neuropathy). The antitumor activity of Vincristine is thought to be due primarily to inhibition of mitosis at metaphase through its interaction with tubulin. Like other vinca alkaloids, Vincristine may also interfere with: 1) amino acid, cyclic AMP, and glutathione metabolism, 2) calmodulin-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transport ATPase activity, 3) cellular respiration, and 4) nucleic acid and lipid biosynthesis. ~75% Vincristine is a vinca alkaloid antineoplastic agent used as a treatment for various cancers including breast cancer, Hodgkin's disease, Kaposi's sarcoma, and testicular cancer. The vinca alkaloids are structurally similar compounds comprised of 2 multiringed units, vindoline and catharanthine. The vinca alkaloids have become clinically useful since the discovery of their antitumour properties in 1959. Initially, extracts of the periwinkle plant (Catharanthus roseus) were investigated because of putative hypoglycemic properties, but were noted to cause marrow suppression in rats and antileukemic effects <i>in vitro</i>. Vincristine binds to the microtubular proteins of the mitotic spindle, leading to crystallization of the microtubule and mitotic arrest or cell death. Vincristine has some immunosuppressant effect. The vinca alkaloids are considered to be cell cycle phase-specific. Treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphomas, Wilms' tumor, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma.

Carbamazepine, also known as Tegretol, is an anticonvulsant drug and analgesic drug used to control seizures and to treat pain resulting from trigeminal neuralgia. It was initially approved by the FDA in 1965. Aside from the above uses, this drug is also given to control the symptoms of bipolar 1. Interestingly, carbamazepine was the first anticonvulsant used to treat individuals with bipolar disorder. Carbamazepine's mechanism of action is not fully elucidated and is widely debated. One major hypothesis is that carbamazepine inhibits sodium channel firing, treating seizure activity. Animal research studies have demonstrated that carbamazepine exerts its effects by lowering polysynaptic nerve response and inhibiting post-tetanic potentiation. In both cats and rats, carbamazepine was shown to decrease pain caused by infraorbital nerve stimulation. A decrease in the action potential in the nucleus ventralis of the thalamus in the brain and inhibition of the lingual mandibular reflex were observed in other studies after carbamazepine use. Carbamazepine causes the above effects by binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels and preventing action potentials, which normally lead to stimulatory effects on nerves. In bipolar disorder, carbamazepine is thought to increase dopamine turnover and increase GABA transmission, treating manic and depressive symptoms. Carbamazepine is 75%-80% bound to plasma proteins. One pharmacokinetic study indicates that it is 72% bound to plasma proteins. **General effects** Carbamazepine is indicated for the treatment of epilepsy and pain associated with true trigeminal neuralgia. In particular, carbamazepine has shown efficacy in treating mixed seizures, partial seizures with complex symptoms, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Carbamazepine is also indicated for the treatment of manic episodes and mixed manic-depressive episodes caused by bipolar I disorder. Some off-label, unapproved uses of carbamazepine include the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome and restless leg syndrome.\"\n",
      "Nicardipine_(14959),\"Nicardipine belongs to drug node. A potent calcium channel blockader with marked vasodilator action. It has antihypertensive properties and is effective in the treatment of angina and coronary spasms without showing cardiodepressant effects. It has also been used in the treatment of asthma and enhances the action of specific antineoplastic agents.  By deforming the channel, inhibiting ion-control gating mechanisms, and/or interfering with the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, nicardipine inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes The decrease in intracellular calcium inhibits the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells, causing dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure, and decreased afterload. >95% Nicardipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker, is used alone or with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, to treat hypertension, chronic stable angina pectoris, and Prinzmetal's variant angina. Nicardipine is similar to other peripheral vasodilators. Nicardipine inhibits the influx of extra cellular calcium across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes possibly by deforming the channel, inhibiting ion-control gating mechanisms, and/or interfering with the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The decrease in intracellular calcium inhibits the contractile processes of the myocardial smooth muscle cells, causing dilation of the coronary and systemic arteries, increased oxygen delivery to the myocardial tissue, decreased total peripheral resistance, decreased systemic blood pressure, and decreased afterload. Used for the management of patients with chronic stable angina and for the treatment of hypertension.\"\n",
      "Astemizole_(14960),\"Astemizole belongs to drug node. Astemizole is a long-acting, non-sedating second generation antihistamine used in the treatment of allergy symptoms. It was withdrawn from market by the manufacturer in 1999 due to the potential to cause arrhythmias at high doses, especially when when taken with CYP inhibitors or grapefruit juice. Astemizole competes with histamine for binding at H<sub>1</sub>-receptor sites in the GI tract, uterus, large blood vessels, and bronchial muscle. This reversible binding of astemizole to H<sub>1</sub>-receptors suppresses the formation of edema, flare, and pruritus resulting from histaminic activity. As the drug does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier and preferentially binds at H1 receptors in the peripehery rather than within the brain, CNS depression is minimal. Astemizole may also act on H<sub>3</sub>-receptors, producing adverse effects. 96.7% Astemizole is a second generation H<sub>1</sub>-receptor antagonist. It does not significantly cross the blood brain barrier and therefore does not cause drowsiness or CNS depression at normal doses. Astemizole was indicated for use in the relieving allergy symptoms, particularly rhinitis and conjunctivitis. It has been withdrawn from the market however due to concerns of arrhythmias.\"\n",
      "Simvastatin_(14961),\"Simvastatin belongs to drug node. Simvastatin, also known as the brand name product Zocor, is a lipid-lowering drug derived synthetically from a fermentation product of _Aspergillus terreus_. It belongs to the statin class of medications, which are used to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and manage abnormal lipid levels by inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as \\bad cholesterol\\\"\"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.\"\" Simvastatin is a prodrug in which the 6-membered lactone ring of simvastatin is hydrolyzed <i>in vivo</i> to generate the beta,delta-dihydroxy acid, an active metabolite structurally similar to HMG-CoA (hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA). Once hydrolyzed, simvastatin competes with HMG-CoA for HMG-CoA reductase, a hepatic microsomal enzyme, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Simvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Simvastatin also inhibits hepatic synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). The overall effect is a decrease in plasma LDL and VLDL.  Both simvastatin and its β-hydroxyacid metabolite are highly bound (approximately 95%) to human plasma proteins. Simvastatin is an oral antilipemic agent which inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, rosuvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Simvastatin is indicated for the treatment of hyperlipidemia to reduce elevated total cholesterol (total-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‑C), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), and triglycerides (TG), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C).\"\n",
      "Trazodone_(14962),\"Trazodone belongs to drug node. Trazodone is triazolopyridine derivative from the serotonin receptor antagonists and reuptake inhibitors (SARIs) class of antidepressants. It is used in adults and has been shown to be comparable in efficacy to other drugs such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin-norepinephrine receptor inhibitor (SNRIs) in the treatment of depression. A unique feature of this drug is that it does not promote the anxiety symptoms, sexual symptoms, or insomnia, which are commonly associated with SSRI and SNRI therapy. Trazodone acts on various receptors, including certain histamine, serotonin, and adrenergic receptors, distinguishing it from other antidepressants that cover a narrow range of neurotransmitters. It was initially granted FDA approval in 1981. The mechanism of action of trazodone is not fully understood, however, it is known to inhibit the reuptake of serotonin and block both histamine and alpha-1-adrenergic receptors. Despite the fact that trazodone is frequently considered a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, several reports have shown that other mechanisms including antagonism at serotonin 5-HT1a, 5-HT1c, and 5-HT2 receptor subtypes may occur. The strongest antagonism of trazodone is reported to occur at the serotonin  The plasma protein binding of trazodone is 89-95% according to in vitro studies. Trazodone treats depressed mood and other depression-related symptoms and shows benefit in the treatment of insomnia due to its sedating effects. It is known to prolong the cardiac QT-interval. Memory, alertness, and cognition may be decreased by trazodone, especially in elderly patients due to its central nervous system depressant effects. Trazodone is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). It has been used off-label for adjunct therapy in alcohol dependence, and off-label to treat anxiety and insomnia. It may also be used off-label to treat symptoms of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, eating disorders, and fibromyalgia due to its effects on various neurotransmitter receptors.\"\n",
      "Mycophenolate mofetil_(14964),\"Mycophenolate mofetil belongs to drug node. Mycophenolate mofetil, also known as MMF or CellCept, is a prodrug of mycophenolic acid, and classified as a reversible inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH). This drug is an immunosuppressant combined with drugs such as and corticosteroids to prevent organ rejection after hepatic, renal, and cardiac transplants. It is marketed by Roche Pharmaceuticals and was granted FDA approval for the prophylaxis of transplant rejection in 1995. In addition to the above uses, mycophenolate mofetil has also been studied for the treatment of nephritis and other complications of autoimmune diseases. Unlike another immunosuppressant class, the calcineurin inhibitors, MMF generally does not cause nephrotoxicity or fibrosis. The active metabolite of mycophenolate, mycophenolic acid, prevents T-cell and B-cell proliferation and the production of cytotoxic T-cells and antibodies. Lymphocyte and monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells of blood vessels that normally part of inflammation is prevented via the glycosylation of cell adhesion molecules by MPA. MPA inhibits de novo purine biosynthesis (that promotes immune cell proliferation) by inhibiting inosine 5’-monophosphate dehydrogenase enzyme (IMPDH), with a preferential inhibition of IMPDH II. IMPDH normally transforms inosine monophosphate (IMP) to xanthine monophosphate (XMP), a metabolite contributing to the production of guanosine triphosphate (GTP). GTP is an important molecule for the synthesis of ribonucleic acid (RNA), deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and protein. As a result of the above cascade of effects, mycophenolate mofetil reduces de-novo production of guanosine nucleotides, interfering with the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and protein required for immune cell production. Further contributing to the above anti-inflammatory effects, MMF depletes tetrahydrobiopterin, causing the decreased function of inducible nitric oxide synthase enzyme, in turn decreasing the production of peroxynitrite, a molecule that promotes inflammation. The protein binding of mycophenolic acid, the metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil, is 97% and it is mainly bound to albumin. MPAG, the inactive metabolite, is 82% bound to plasma albumin at normal therapeutic concentrations. At elevated MPAG concentrations due to various reasons, including renal impairment, the binding of MPA may be decreased due to competition for binding. Mycophenolate mofetil is a prodrug of mycophenolic acid (MPA). The active form of mycophenolate, MPA, prevents the proliferation of immune cells and the formation of antibodies that cause transplant rejection. The above effects lead to higher rates of successful transplantation, avoiding the devastating effects of graft rejection. Mycophenolate mofetil is indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients undergoing allogeneic renal, hepatic, or cardiac transplants. It should be used with cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Mycophenolate mofetil may also be used off-label as a second-line treatment for autoimmune hepatitis that has not responded adequately to first-line therapy. Other off-label uses of this drug include lupus-associated nephritis and dermatitis in children.\"\n",

      "Mifepristone_(14973),\"Mifepristone belongs to drug node. Mifepristone is a progestational and glucocorticoid hormone antagonist. Its inhibition of progesterone induces bleeding during the luteal phase and in early pregcy by releasing endogenous prostaglandins from the endometrium or decidua. As a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, the drug has been used to treat hypercortisolism in patients with nonpituitary cushing syndrome. The two marketed forms of mifepristone are Mifeprex® (mifepristone 200mg) and Korlym™ (mifepristone 300mg). Currently under investigation for use in psychotic depression (phase 3 trials). The anti-progestational activity of mifepristone results from competitive interaction with progesterone at progesterone-receptor sites. Based on studies with various oral doses in several animal species (mouse, rat, rabbit and monkey), the compound inhibits the activity of endogenous or exogenous progesterone. The termination of pregcy results. 98% (bound to plasma proteins, albumin and a 1-acid glycoprotein) Mifepristone is a synthetic steroid with antiprogestational effects indicated for the medical termination of intrauterine pregcy through 49 days' pregcy.

      "Vardenafil_(14974),\"Vardenafil belongs to drug node. Vardenafil (Levitra) is an oral therapy for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. It is a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). Penile erection is a hemodynamic process initiated by the relaxation of smooth muscle in the corpus cavernosum and its associated arterioles. During sexual stimulation, nitric oxide is released from nerve endings and endothelial cells in the corpus cavernosum. Nitric oxide activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase resulting in increased synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the smooth muscle cells of the corpus cavernosum. The cGMP in turn triggers smooth muscle relaxation, allowing increased blood flow into the penis, resulting in erection. The tissue concentration of cGMP is regulated by both the rates of synthesis and degradation via phosphodiesterases (PDEs). The most abundant PDE in the human corpus cavernosum is the cGMPspecific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5); therefore, the inhibition of PDE5 enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP. Vardenafil inhibits the cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum located around the penis. Penile erection during sexual stimulation is caused by increased penile blood flow resulting from the relaxation of penile arteries and corpus cavernosal smooth muscle. This response is mediated by the release of nitric oxide (NO) from nerve terminals and endothelial cells, which stimulates the synthesis of cGMP in smooth muscle cells. Cyclic GMP causes smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow into the corpus cavernosum. The inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) by vardenafil enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP. 95% Vardenafil is used to treat male erectile dysfunction (impotence) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Part of the physiological process of erection involves the release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum. This then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), leading to smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in increased inflow of blood and an erection. Vardenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. This means that, with vardenafil on board, normal sexual stimulation leads to increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum which leads to better erections. Without sexual stimulation and no activation of the NO/cGMP system, vardenafil should not cause an erection. Used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction\"\n",

A macrolide compound obtained from Streptomyces hygroscopicus that acts by selectively blocking the transcriptional activation of cytokines thereby inhibiting cytokine production. It is bioactive only when bound to immunophilins. Sirolimus is a potent immunosuppressant and possesses both antifungal and antineoplastic properties. Sirolimus inhibits T lymphocyte activation and proliferation that occurs in response to antigenic and cytokine (Interleukin IL-2, IL-4, and IL-15) stimulation by a mechanism that is distinct from that of other immunosuppressants. Sirolimus also inhibits antibody production. In cells, sirolimus binds to the immunophilin, FK Binding Protein-12 (FKBP-12), to generate an immunosuppressive complex. The sirolimus:FKBP-12 complex has no effect on calcineurin activity. This complex binds to and inhibits the activation of the mammalian Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulatory kinase. This inhibition suppresses cytokine-driven T-cell proliferation, inhibiting the progression from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle. 92% Sirolimus, a macrocyclic lactone produced by <i>Streptomyces hygroscopicus</i>, is an immunosuppressive agent indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients receiving renal transplants.

      "Zonisamide_(14979),\"Zonisamide belongs to drug node. Zonisamide is a sulfonamide anticonvulsant approved for use as an adjunctive therapy in adults with partial-onset seizures. Zonisamide may be a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor although this is not one of the primary mechanisms of action. Zonisamide may act by blocking repetitive firing of voltage-gated sodium channels leading to a reduction of T-type calcium channel currents, or by binding allosterically to GABA receptors. This latter action may inhibit the uptake of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA while enhancing the uptake of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. Zonisamide binds to sodium channels and voltage sensitive calcium channels, which suppresses neuronal depolarization and hypersynchronization. Zonisamide also inhibits carbonic anhydrase to a weaker extent, but such an effect is not thought to contribute substantially to the drug's anticonvulsant activity. 40% (at concentrations of 1.0-7.0 &micro;g/mL) Zonisamide is a sulfonamide and therefore unrelated to other seizure medications. The mechanism is not know but it may block sodium and calcium channels. Blocking of these channels may prevent neuronal hypersynchronization. Sonisamide has also been found to potentiate dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission but does not appear to potentiate syanptic activity by GABA (gamma amino butyric acid).

Ixabepilone is administered through injection, and will be marketed under the trade name Ixempra. Ixabepilone is a semisynthetic analogue of epothilone B. It has a lactone–lactam modification that minimizes susceptibility to esterase degradation. Binding of Ixabepilone to beta-tubulins (e.g. beta-III tubulin) stabilizes microtubules. Microtubules are essential to cell division, and epothilones therefore stop cells from properly dividing. Like taxol, Ixabepilone binds to the αβ-tubulin heterodimer subunit. Once bound, the rate of αβ-tubulin dissociation decreases, thus stabilizing the microtubules. 67-77%  Investigated for use/treatment in breast cancer, head and neck cancer, melanoma, lung cancer, lymphoma (non-hodgkin's), prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and cancer/tumors (unspecified).\"\n",
      "Flibanserin_(15543),\"Flibanserin belongs to drug node. Flibanserin is the first drug to be approved for hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in premenopausal women by the FDA in August 2015. It was originally developed as an antidepressant medication by Boehringer Ingelheim, but showed lack of efficacy in trials and was further developed as a hypoactive sexual disorder drug by Sprout Pharmaceuticals. Flibanserin's mechanism of action is attributed to its high affinity for 5-HTA1 and 5-HTA2 receptors, displaying agonist activity on 5-HTA1 and antagonist on 5-HTA2, resulting in lowering of serotonin in the brain as well as an effect on increasing norepinephrine and dopamine neurotransmitters. Flibansetrin has high affinity for serotonin receptors in the brain: it acts as an agonist on 5-HT1A and an antagonist on 5-HT2A. In vivo, flibanserin binds equally to 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors. However, under higher levels of brain 5-HT (i.e., under stress), flibanserin may occupy 5-HT2A receptors in higher proportion than 5-HT(1A) receptors. It may also moderately antagonize D4 (dopamine) receptors and 5-HT2B and 5-HTB2C. Its action on neurotransmitter receptors may contribute to reduction in serotonin levels and increase in dopamine and norepinephrine levels, all of which may play part in reward processing.  ~98%, highly bound to proteins (mostly albumin) in serum.   For the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in premenopausal women. \"\n",
      "Indacaterol_(15546),\"Indacaterol belongs to drug node. Indacaterol is a novel, ultra-long-acting, rapid onset β(2)-adrenoceptor agonist developed for Novartis for the once-daily management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on 30 November 2009 and by the FDA on 1 July 2011. It is marketed in Europe as Onbrez and in America as Arcapta Neohaler. Indacaterol is provided as its maleate salt form. Indacaterol is also a chiral molecule but only the pure R-etiomer is dispensed. Indacaterol works by stimulating adrenergic beta-2 receptors in the smooth muscle of the airways. This causes relaxation of the muscle, thereby increasing the diameter of the airways, which become constricted in asthma and COPD. It is also long acting due to its high affinity to the lipid raft domains in the airway membrane so it slowly dissociates from the receptors. Indacaterol also has a high intrinsic efficacy so it is also very rapid acting - onset of action occurs within 5 minutes.  The in vitro human serum and plasma protein binding was 94.1-95.3% and 95.1-96.2%, respectively. Bronchodilator drugs are the foundation for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The principal inhaled bronchodilator treatments used are β(2) -agonists and anticholinergics, either alone or in combination. Currently available β(2) -agonists are of either short duration and used multiple times/day, or of long duration, which requires twice-daily administration. Indacaterol is considered an ultra-long-acting β(2) -agonist and was recently approved for use in the United States. Its duration of action is approximately 24 hours, allowing for once-daily administration. Furthermore, this chiral compound it is given as the R-etiomer and acts as a full agonist. Cough was the most commonly reported adverse effect with use of indacaterol. Compared to salmeterol, it has 35% more agonist activity. Cough usually occurred within 15 seconds of inhalation of the drug, lasted around 6 seconds, was not associated with bronchospasm, and did not cause discontinuation of the drug. Otherwise, the drug's safety profile was similar to that of other bronchodilators.  For the long term, once-daily-dosing maintece of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema.\"\n",
      "Silodosin_(15557),\"Silodosin belongs to drug node. Silodosin is an α1-adrenoceptor antagonist that is selective for the prostate. Silodosin is for symptomatic treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. FDA approved Oct 9, 2008. Benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), or an enlarged prostate, is a condition found only in men and is characterized by a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland. Symptoms of BPH include urinary difficulty, urinary frequency and an inability to complete bladder emptying. Silodosin is highly uroselective for the alpha (1A) receptors located in the prostate,. Blocking these receptors relaxes the smooth muscles, resulting in an improvement in urine flow and a reduction in BPH symptoms. The selective binding of silodosin to the alpha (1A) receptors is substantially greater than the binding to the cardiovascular-associated alpha (1B) receptors and thereby maximizes target organ activity while minimizing the potential for blood pressure effects. Silodosin is alpha 1A-adrenoceptor selective antagonist which inhibits sympathetic nerve stimulation and relaxation of smooth muscle tone in the lower urinary tract which relieves the pressure from contraction of smooth muscle. The reduction of intraurethral pressure improves voiding and storage issues associated with BPH.  97% bound to protein  Silodosin is 583 times more selective for human alpha-1A receptors than alpha-1B receptors.

Tolvaptan is used to treat low blood sodium levels (hyponatremia) associated with various conditions like congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormones (SIADH). FDA approved on May 19, 2009. Tolvaptan is a selective and competitive arginine vasopressin receptor 2 antagonist. Vasopressin acts on the V2 receptors found in the walls of the vasculature and luminal membranes of renal collecting ducts. By blocking V2 receptors in the renal collecting ducts, aquaporins do not insert themselves into the walls thus preventing water absorption. This action ultimately results in an increase in urine volume, decrease urine osmolality, and increase electrolyte-free water clearance to reduce intravascular volume and an increase serum sodium levels. Tolvaptan is especially useful for heart failure patients as they have higher serum levels of vasopressin.  99% bound  Urine volume and fluid intake increase in a dose dependent manner which results in overall negative fluid balance in patients taking tolvaptan. Increases in serum sodium and osmolality can be observed 4-8 hours post-administration and is maintained for 24 hours. The magnitude of serum sodium and osmolality change increases with escalating doses. Furthermore, a decrease in urine osmolality and increase in free water clearance can be observed 4 hours after post-administration of tolvaptan. The affinity for V2 receptors is 29x greater than that of V1a receptors and does not have any appreciable affinity for V2 receptors.

Compared to other tyrosine kinase inhibitors, it has a more favourable hematologic toxicity profile. FDA approved on September 4, 2012. Bosutinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Although it is able to inhibit several tyrosine kinases such as Src, Lyn, and Hck, which are members of the Src-family of kinases, its primary target is the Bcr-Abl kinase. The Bcr-Abl gene is a chimeric oncogene created from the fusion of the breakpoint-cluster (Bcr) gene and Abelson (Abl) tyrosine gene. This chromosomal abnormality results in the formation of what is commonly known as the Philadelphia chromosome or Philadelphia translocation. The Bcr-Abl gene expresses a particular kinase that promotes the progression of CML. A decrease in the growth and size of the CML tumour has been observed following administration of bosutinib. Bosutinib did not inhibit the T315I and V299L mutant cells.  94% bound to human plasma proteins in vitro. 96% bound to human plasma proteins in healthy subjects ex vivo.

      "Isavuconazonium_(15573),\"Isavuconazonium belongs to drug node. Isavuconazonium is a second-generation triazole antifungal approved on March 6, 2015 by the FDA for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis and invasive mucormycosis, marketed by Astellas under the brand Cresemba. It is the prodrug form of isavuconazole, the active moiety, and it is available in oral and parenteral formulations. Due to low solubility in water of isavuconazole on its own, the isovuconazonium formulation is favorable as it has high solubility in water and allows for intravenous administration. This formulation also avoids the use of a cyclodextrin vehicle for solubilization required for intravenous administration of other antifungals such as voriconazole and posaconazole, eliminating concerns of nephrotoxicity associated with cyclodextrin. Isovuconazonium has excellent oral bioavailability, predictable pharmacokinetics, and a good safety profile, making it a reasonable alternative to its few other competitors on the market. Antifungals in the triazole class, such as isavuconazonium, target and inhibit the sterol 14-α-demethylase (Erg11p) which is a key player in the demethylation step of the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway. This inhibition results in a halt in production of ergosterol, a molecule typically found in the membranes of fungi such as Aspergillus, Candida, and Mucorales that plays a role in regulation of membrane integrity, fluidity and permeability. The inhibition of Erg11p also causes the buildup of ergosterol precursors, which are toxic and cause cell death.  >99%  Indicated in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis and invasive mucormycosis.\"\n",

      "Fidaxomicin_(15595),\"Fidaxomicin belongs to drug node. Fidaxomicin is a novel macrolide antibiotic used in the treatment of diarrhea caused by _Clostridioides_ (formerly _Clostridium_) _difficile_ in adult and pediatric patients over the age of 6 months. Fidaxomicin is a naturally-occurring 18-member macrocycle derived from fermentation. Because fidaxomicin contains an 18-membered lactone ring in its structure, it is referred to as a macrocyclic lactone antibiotic drug. The antibacterial activity of fidaxomicin is distinct from macrolides and rifamycins, as the bactericidal activity is time-dependent, and not concentration-dependent. Fidaxomicin was the first macrocyclic lactone antibiotic with activity against _C. difficile_, and it displays a narrow spectrum of activity against gram-positive anaerobes. It mediates its potent bactericidal action on the bacteria by inhibiting the bacterial RNA synthase, thereby disrupting bacterial transcription. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC<sub>90</sub>) for fidaxomicin is four times less than that of , which was the primary drug of choice for _C. difficile_ infection before the approval of fidaxomicin. Unlike vancomycin, however, fidaxomicin has a negligible effect on normal colonic microflora. _Clostridium difficile_ is a Gram-positive bacterium that causes various gastrointestinal complications, such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea. _C. difficile_ infection can be caused by antibiotic therapy, resulting in the disruption of the human gut flora leads to an overgrowth of _C. difficile_. The consequences of _C. difficile_ infection can be mild to severe and sometimes fatal.  Since fidaxomicin has minimal systemic absorption following oral administration, there is limited information on the plasma protein binding profile of fidoxamicin. Fidaxomicin has a narrow-spectrum antibacterial profile, with potent bactericidal activity specifically against C. difficile. The minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of organisms for fidaxomicin against _C. difficile_ ranged from 0.0078 to 2 μg/mL _in vitro_. The bactericidal activity of fidaxomicin is time-dependent. Other than _C. difficile_, fidaxomicin has moderate inhibitory activity against Gram-positive bacteria (_S. aureus_ and _Enterococcus spp._) and poor activity against normal colonic flora, including anaerobes and enteric Gram-negative bacilli. Isolates of _C. difficile_ that are resistant to rifamycins or other antimicrobial classes (such as cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, clindamycin) were not shown to be cross-resistant to fidaxomicin. Fidaxomicin is indicated for the treatment of _Clostridioides_ (formerly _Clostridium_) _difficile_-associated diarrhea in adult and pediatric patients 6 months of age and older.\"\n",

It is frequently used to treat gastrointestinal infections as well as trichomoniasis and giardiasis, and amebiasis which are parasitic infections. Metronidazole has been used as an antibiotic for several decades, with added antiparasitic properties that set it apart from many other antibacterial drugs, allowing it to treat a wide variety of infections. It is available in capsule form, tablet form, and topical form, and suppository preparations for the treatment of various infections. The exact mechanism of action of metronidazole has not been fully established, however, it is possible that an intermediate in the reduction of metronidazole which is only made by anaerobic bacteria and protozoa, binds deoxyribonucleic acid and electron-transport proteins of organisms, blocking nucleic acid synthesis. Metronidazole is less than 20% bound to plasma proteins. Metronidazole treats amebiasis, trichomoniasis, and giardiasis, exerting both antibacterial and antiprotozoal activities. Metronidazole is an effective treatment for some anaerobic bacterial infections. Metronidazole has shown antibacterial activity against the majority of obligate anaerobes, however, during in vitro studies, it does not demonstrate significant action against facultative anaerobes or obligate aerobes. The nitro group reduction of metronidazole by anaerobic organisms is likely responsible for the drug's antimicrobial cytotoxic effects, causing DNA strand damage to microbes. Metronidazole is indicated for the treatment of confirmed trichomoniasis caused by Trichomonas vaginalis (except for in the first trimester of pregcy) and the patient's sexual partners, bacterial vaginosis, certain types of amebiasis, and various anaerobic infections. The above anaerobic infections may occur on the skin and skin structures, the abdomen, the heart, reproductive organs, central nervous system, and the respiratory system. Some may also be present in the bloodstream in cases of septicemia.

      "Buprenorphine_(14981),\"Buprenorphine belongs to drug node. Buprenorphine is a weak partial mu-opioid receptor agonist and a weak kappa-opioid receptor antagonist used for the treatment of severe pain. It is also commonly used as an alternative to for the treatment of severe opioid addiction. Buprenorphine is commercially available as the brand name product Suboxone which is formulated in a 4:1 fixed-dose combination product along with , a non-selective competitive opioid receptor antagonist. Combination with naloxone is intended to reduce the abuse potential of Suboxone, as naloxone is poorly absorbed by the oral route (and has no effect when taken orally), but would reverse the opioid agonist effects of buprenorphine if injected intravenously. Buprenorphine has poor gastrointestinal absorption and is therefore formulated as a sublingual tablet. Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and an antagonist at the kappa-opioid receptor. It demonstrates a high affinity for the mu-opioid receptor but has lower intrinsic activity compared to other full mu-opioid agonists such as , , or. This means that buprenorphine preferentially binds the opioid receptor and displaces lower affinity opioids without activating the receptor to a comparable degree. Clinically, this results in a slow onset of action and a clinical phenomenon known as the \\ceiling effect\\\"\" where once a certain dose is reached buprenorphine's effects plateau. This effect can be beneficial, however, as dose-related side effects such as respiratory depression, sedation, and intoxication also plateau at around 32mg, resulting in a lower risk of overdose compared to and other full agonist opioids. It also means that opioid-dependent patients do not experience sedation or euphoria at the same rate that they might experience with more potent opioids, improving quality of life for patients with severe pain and reducing the reinforcing effects of opioids which can lead to drug-seeking behaviours.\"\" Buprenorphine is approximately 96% protein-bound, primarily to alpha- and beta-globulin. Buprenorphine interacts predominately with the opioid mu-receptor. These mu-binding sites are discretely distributed in the human brain, spinal cord, and other tissues. In clinical settings, buprenorphine exerts its principal pharmacologic effects on the central nervous system. Its primary actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation. In addition to analgesia, alterations in mood, euphoria and dysphoria, and drowsiness commonly occur. Buprenorphine depresses the respiratory centers, depresses the cough reflex, and constricts the pupils.  Buprenorphine is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. Buprenorphine is also used in combination with in a fixed-dose combination product for the treatment of moderate to severe opioid use disorder.\"\n",
      "Azelastine_(14983),\"Azelastine belongs to drug node. Azelastine, a phthalazine derivative, is an antihistamine available as an intranasal spray for the treatment of allergic and vasomotor rhinitis and as an ophthalmic solution for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. It is a racemic mixture, though there is no noted difference in pharmacologic activity between etiomers, and was first granted FDA approval in 1996. Azelastine is also available in combination with fluticasone propionate as a nasal spray marketed under the trade name Dymista™, which is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis in patients 6 years of age and older. Azelastine is primarily a selective antagonist of histamine H1-receptors, with a lesser affinity for H2-receptors, used for the symptomatic treatment of allergies. Histamine H1-receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors with 7 transmembrane spanning domains that are found on nerve endings, smooth muscle cells, and glandular cells. Following allergen exposure in sensitized individuals, IgE-receptor cross-linking on mast cells results in the release of histamine, which binds to H1-receptors and contributes to typical allergic symptoms such as itching, sneezing, and congestion.  In-vitro studies in human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of azelastine and desmethylazelastine are approximately 88% and 97%, respectively. Azelastine antagonizes the actions of histamine, resulting in the relief of histamine-mediated allergy symptoms. Onset of action occurs within 15 minutes with intranasal formulations and as quickly as 3 minutes with ophthalmic solutions. Intranasal formulations have a relatively long-duration of action, with peak effects observed 4-6 hours after the initial dose and efficacy maintained over the entirety of the standard 12 hour dosing interval. Intranasal azelastine is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis in patients 5 years and older and for the symptomatic treatment of vasomotor rhinitis in patients 12 years and older. Ophthalmic azelastine solution is indicated for the treatment of itchy eyes associated with allergic conjunctivitis.\"\n",
      "Felodipine_(14984),\"Felodipine belongs to drug node. Felodipine is a long-acting 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB)b. It acts primarily on vascular smooth muscle cells by stabilizing voltage-gated L-type calcium channels in their inactive conformation. By inhibiting the influx of calcium in smooth muscle cells, felodipine prevents calcium-dependent myocyte contraction and vasoconstriction. Felodipine is the most potent CCB in use and is unique in that it exhibits fluorescent activity. In addition to binding to L-type calcium channels, felodipine binds to a number of calcium-binding proteins, exhibits competitive antagonism of the mineralcorticoid receptor, inhibits the activity of calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, and blocks calcium influx through voltage-gated T-type calcium channels. Felodipine is used to treat mild to moderate essential hypertension. Felodipine decreases arterial smooth muscle contractility and subsequent vasoconstriction by inhibiting the influx of calcium ions through voltage-gated L-type calcium channels. It reversibly competes against nitrendipine and other DHP CCBs for DHP binding sites in vascular smooth muscle and cultured rabbit atrial cells. Calcium ions entering the cell through these channels bind to calmodulin. Calcium-bound calmodulin then binds to and activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Activated MLCK catalyzes the phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain subunit of myosin, a key step in muscle contraction. Signal amplification is achieved by calcium-induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through ryanodine receptors. Inhibition of the initial influx of calcium decreases the contractile activity of arterial smooth muscle cells and results in vasodilation. The vasodilatory effects of felodipine result in an overall decrease in blood pressure. Felodipine may be used to treat mild to moderate essential hypertension. 99%, primarily to the albumin fraction.  Felodipine belongs to the dihydropyridine (DHP) class of calcium channel blockers (CCBs), the most widely used class of CCBs. There are at least five different types of calcium channels in Homo sapiens: L-, N-, P/Q-, R- and T-type. It was widely accepted that CCBs target L-type calcium channels, the major channel in muscle cells that mediates contraction; however, some studies have shown that felodipine also binds to and inhibits T-type calcium channels. T-type calcium channels are most commonly found on neurons, cells with pacemaker activity and on osteocytes. The pharmacologic significance of T-type calcium channel blockade is unknown. Felodipine also binds to calmodulin and inhibits calmodulin-dependent calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The effect of this interaction appears to be minor. Another study demonstrated that felodipine attenuates the activity of calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (CaMPDE) by binding to the PDE-1B1 and PDE-1A2 enzyme subunits. CaMPDE is one of the key enzymes involved in cyclic nucleotides and calcium second messenger systems. Felodipine also acts as an antagonist to the mineralcorticoid receptor by competing with aldosterone for binding and blocking aldosterone-induced coactivator recruitment of the mineralcorticoid receptor. Felodipine is able to bind to skeletal and cardiac muscle isoforms of troponin C, one of the key regulatory proteins in muscle contraction. Though felodipine exhibits binding to many endogenous molecules, its vasodilatory effects are still thought to be brought about primarily through inhibition of voltage-gated L-type calcium channels. Similar to other DHP CCBs, felodipine binds directly to inactive calcium channels stabilizing their inactive conformation. Since arterial smooth muscle depolarizations are longer in duration than cardiac muscle depolarizations, inactive channels are more prevalent in smooth muscle cells. Alternative splicing of the alpha-1 subunit of the channel gives felodipine additional arterial selectivity. At therapeutic sub-toxic concentrations, felodipine has little effect on cardiac myocytes and conduction cells. For the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension. \"\n",

Although the precise mechanism of action is unknown, blockade of postsynaptic dopamine receptors has been postulated. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p403) The ability of pimozide to suppress motor and phonic tics in Tourette's Disorder is thought to be primarily a function of its dopaminergic blocking activity. Pimozide binds and inhibits the dopamine D2 receptor in the CNS.   Pimozide is an orally active antipsychotic drug product which shares with other antipsychotics the ability to blockade dopaminergic receptors on neurons in the central nervous system. However, receptor blockade is often accompanied by a series of secondary alterations in central dopamine metabolism and function which may contribute to both pimozide's therapeutic and untoward effects. In addition, pimozide, in common with other antipsychotic drugs, has various effects on other central nervous system receptor systems which are not fully characterized. Pimozide also has less potential for inducing sedation and hypotension as it has more specific dopamine receptor blocking activity than other neuroleptic agents (and is therefore a suitable alternative to haloperidol). Used for the suppression of motor and phonic tics in patients with Tourette's Disorder who have failed to respond satisfactorily to standard treatment.\"\n",
      "Quinacrine_(14989),\"Quinacrine belongs to drug node. An acridine derivative formerly widely used as an antimalarial but superseded by chloroquine in recent years. It has also been used as an anthelmintic and in the treatment of giardiasis and maligt effusions. It is used in cell biological experiments as an inhibitor of phospholipase A2. The exact mechanism of antiparasitic action is unknown; however, quinacrine binds to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in vitro by intercalation between adjacent base pairs, inhibiting transcription and translation to ribonucleic acid (RNA). Quinacrine does not appear to localize to the nucleus of Giaridia trophozoites, suggesting that DNA binding may not be the primary mechanism of its antimicrobial action. Fluorescence studies using Giardia suggest that the outer membranes may be involved. Quinacrine inhibits succinate oxidation and interferes with electron transport. In addition, by binding to nucleoproteins, quinacrine suppress the lupus erythematous cell factor and acts as a strong inhibitor of cholinesterase. 80-90% Quinacrine has been used as an antimalarial drug and as an antibiotic. It is used to treat giardiasis, a protozoal infection of the intestinal tract, and certain types of lupus erythematosus, an inflammatory disease that affects the joints, tendons, and other connective tissues and organs. Quinacrine may be injected into the space surrounding the lungs to prevent reoccurrence of pneumothorax. The exact way in which quinacrine works is unknown. It appears to interfere with the parasite's metabolism. For the treatment of giardiasis and cutaneous leishmaniasis and the management of maligt effusions.\"\n",
      "Itraconazole_(14992),\"Itraconazole belongs to drug node. One of the triazole antifungal agents that inhibits cytochrome P-450-dependent enzymes resulting in impairment of ergosterol synthesis. It has been used against histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, cryptococcal meningitis & aspergillosis. Itraconazole interacts with 14-&alpha; demethylase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme necessary to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. As ergosterol is an essential component of the fungal cell membrane, inhibition of its synthesis results in increased cellular permeability causing leakage of cellular contents. Itraconazole may also inhibit endogenous respiration, interact with membrane phospholipids, inhibit the transformation of yeasts to mycelial forms, inhibit purine uptake, and impair triglyceride and/or phospholipid biosynthesis. 99.8% Itraconazole is an imidazole/triazole type antifungal agent. Itraconazole is a highly selective inhibitor of fungal cytochrome P-450 sterol C-14 &alpha;-demethylation via the inhibition of the enzyme cytochrome P450 14&alpha;-demethylase. This enzyme converts lanosterol to ergosterol, and is required in fungal cell wall synthesis. The subsequent loss of normal sterols correlates with the accumulation of 14 &alpha;-methyl sterols in fungi and may be partly responsible for the fungistatic activity of fluconazole. Mammalian cell demethylation is much less sensitive to fluconazole inhibition. Itraconazole exhibits <i>in vitro</i> activity against <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> and <i>Candida spp.</i> Fungistatic activity has also been demonstrated in normal and immunocompromised animal models for systemic and intracranial fungal infections due to <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> and for systemic infections due to <i>Candida albicans</i>. For the treatment of the following fungal infections in immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised patients: pulmonary and extrapulmonary blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, aspergillosis, and onychomycosis.\"\n",
      "Phenobarbital_(14993),\"Phenobarbital belongs to drug node. A barbituric acid derivative that acts as a nonselective central nervous system depressant. It promotes binding to inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid subtype receptors, and modulates chloride currents through receptor channels. It also inhibits glutamate induced depolarizations. Phenobarbital acts on GABAA receptors, increasing synaptic inhibition. This has the effect of elevating seizure threshold and reducing the spread of seizure activity from a seizure focus. Phenobarbital may also inhibit calcium channels, resulting in a decrease in excitatory transmitter release. The sedative-hypnotic effects of phenobarbital are likely the result of its effect on the polysynaptic midbrain reticular formation, which controls CNS arousal. 20 to 45% Phenobarbital, the longest-acting barbiturate, is used for its anticonvulsant and sedative-hypnotic properties in the management of all seizure disorders except absence (petit mal).

      "Domperidone_(14994),\"Domperidone belongs to drug node. A specific blocker of dopamine receptors. It speeds gastrointestinal peristalsis, causes prolactin release, and is used as antiemetic and tool in the study of dopaminergic mechanisms. Domperidone acts as a gastrointestinal emptying (delayed) adjunct and peristaltic stimulant. The gastroprokinetic properties of domperidone are related to its peripheral dopamine receptor blocking properties. Domperidone facilitates gastric emptying and decreases small bowel transit time by increasing esophageal and gastric peristalsis and by lowering esophageal sphincter pressure. Antiemetic: The antiemetic properties of domperidone are related to its dopamine receptor blocking activity at both the chemoreceptor trigger zone and at the gastric level. It has strong affinities for the D2 and D3 dopamine receptors, which are found in the chemoreceptor trigger zone, located just outside the blood brain barrier, which - among others - regulates nausea and vomiting 91%-93% Domperidone is a specific blocker of dopamine receptors.

      "Clarithromycin_(14995),\"Clarithromycin belongs to drug node. Clarithromycin, a semisynthetic macrolide antibiotic derived from erythromycin, inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit. Binding inhibits peptidyl transferase activity and interferes with amino acid translocation during the translation and protein assembly process. Clarithromycin may be bacteriostatic or bactericidal depending on the organism and drug concentration. Clarithromycin is first metabolized to 14-OH clarithromycin, which is active and works synergistically with its parent compound. Like other macrolides, it then penetrates bacteria cell wall and reversibly binds to domain V of the 23S ribosomal RNA of the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, blocking translocation of aminoacyl transfer-RNA and polypeptide synthesis. Clarithromycin also inhibits the hepatic microsomal CYP3A4 isoenzyme and P-glycoprotein, an energy-dependent drug efflux pump. ~ 70% protein bound Clarithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic whose spectrum of activity includes many gram-positive (<i>Staphylococcus aureus, S. pneumoniae, and S. pyogenes</i>) and gram-negative aerobic bacteria (<i>Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis</i>), many anaerobic bacteria, some mycobacteria, and some other organisms including <i>Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma, Chlamydia, Toxoplasma</i>, and <i>Borrelia</i>. Other aerobic bacteria that clarithromycin has activity against include <i>C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae</i>. Clarithromycin has an in-vitro activity that is similar or greater than that of erythromycin against erythromycin-susceptible organisms. Clarithromycin is usually bacteriostatic, but may be bactericidal depending on the organism and the drug concentration.

Also for the treatment of pharyngitis and tonsillitis caused by susceptible <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>, as well as respiratory tract infections including acute maxillary sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, mild to moderate community-acquired pneuomia, Legionnaires' disease, and pertussis. Other indications include treatment of uncomplicated skin or skin structure infections, helicobacter pylori infection, duodenal ulcer disease, bartonella infections, early Lyme disease, and encephalitis caused by <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> (in HIV infected patients in conjunction with pyrimethamine). Clarithromycin may also decrease the incidence of cryptosporidiosis, prevent the occurence of α-hemolytic (viridans group) streptococcal endocarditis, as well as serve as a primary prevention for <i>Mycobacterium avium</i> complex (MAC) bacteremia or disseminated infections (in adults, adolescents, and children with advanced HIV infection).\"\n",
      "Anastrozole_(14997),\"Anastrozole belongs to drug node. Anastrozole is a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (AI), similar to , used to decrease circulating estrogen levels in the treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen-responsive breast cancer. Anastrozole is also related to , a steroidal AI, but its non-steroidal nature provides stark advantages including a lack of steroid-associated adverse effects such as weight gain and acne. Aromatase inhibitors, including anastrozole, have become endocrine drugs of choice in the treatment of postmenopausal breast cancer due to a more favourable efficacy and adverse effect profile as compared to earlier estrogen receptor modulators such as. Anastrazole exerts its anti-estrogenic effects via selective and competitive inhibition of the aromatase enzyme found predomitly in the adrenal glands, liver, and fatty tissues. Many breast cancers are hormone receptor-positive, meaning their growth is stimulated and/or maintained by the presence of hormones such as estrogen or progesterone. In postmenopausal women, estrogen is primarily derived from the conversion of adrenally-produced androgens into estrogens by the aromatase enzyme - by competitively inhibiting the biosynthesis of estrogen at these enzymes, anastrozole effectively suppresses circulating estrogen levels and, subsequently, the growth of hormone receptor-positive tumours. Anastrozole is 40% protein bound in plasma and appears to be independent of plasma concentration. Anastrozole prevents the conversion of adrenal androgens (e.g. ) to estrogen in peripheral and tumour tissues. As the growth of many breast cancers is stimulated and/or maintained by the presence of estrogen, anastrozole helps to treat these cancers by decreasing the levels of circulating estrogens. Anastrozole has a relatively long duration of action allowing for once daily dosing - serum estradiol is reduced by approximately 70% within 24 hours of beginning therapy with 1mg once daily, and levels remain suppressed for up to 6 days following cessation of therapy.  Anastrozole is indicated as adjunct therapy in the treatment of hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer in postmenopausal women, and as a first-line treatment for hormone receptor-positive (or hormone receptor-unknown) locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women. It may also be used in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women who experience disease progression despite treatment with. \"\n",
      "Quetiapine_(14999),\"Quetiapine belongs to drug node. Initially approved by the FDA in 1997, quetiapine is a second-generation atypical antipsychotic used in schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder. Quetiapine demonstrates a high level of therapeutic efficacy and low risk of adverse effects during long-term treatment. It is well-tolerated and a suitable option for some patients with high sensitivity to other drugs, such as and. Although the mechanism of action of quetiapine is not fully understood, several proposed mechanisms exist. In schizophrenia, its actions could occur from the antagonism of dopamine type 2 (D2) and serotonin 2A (5HT2A) receptors. In bipolar depression and major depression, quetiapine's actions may be attributed to the binding of this drug or its metabolite to the norepinephrine transporter. Additional effects of quetiapine, including somnolence, orthostatic hypotension, and anticholinergic effects, may result from the antagonism of H1 receptors, adrenergic α1 receptors, and muscarinic M1 receptors, respectively. The protein binding of quetiapine is 83%. Quetiapine improves the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and major depression by acting on various neurotransmitter receptors, such as the serotonin and dopamine receptors. In bipolar disorder, it improves both depressive and manic symptoms. Quetiapine is used in the symptomatic treatment of schizophrenia. In addition, it may be used for the management of acute manic or mixed episodes in patients with bipolar I disorder, as a monotherapy or combined with other drugs. It may be used to manage depressive episodes in bipolar disorder. In addition to the above indications, quetiapine is used in combination with antidepressant drugs for the treatment of major depression.\"\n",
      "Lapatinib_(15000),\"Lapatinib belongs to drug node. Lapatinib is an anti-cancer drug developed by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) as a treatment for solid tumours such as breast and lung cancer. It was approved by the FDA on March 13, 2007, for use in patients with advanced metastatic breast cancer in conjunction with the chemotherapy drug Capecitabine. Lapatinib is human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2/ERBB2) and epidermal growth factor receptor (HER1/EGFR/ERBB1) tyrosine kinases inhibitor. It binds to the intracellular phosphorylation domain to prevent receptor autophosphorylation upon ligand binding. Lapatinib is a 4-anilinoquinazoline kinase inhibitor of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domains of both epidermal growth factor receptor (HER1/EGFR/ERBB1) and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2/ERBB2)with a dissociation half-life of &ge;300 minutes. Lapatinib inhibits ERBB-driven tumor cell growth in vitro and in various animal models. An additive effect was demonstrated in an in vitro study when lapatinib and 5-florouracil (the active metabolite of capecitabine) were used in combination in the 4 tumor cell lines tested. The growth inhibitory effects of lapatinib were evaluated in trastuzumab-conditioned cell lines. Lapatinib retained significant activity against breast cancer cell lines selected for long-term growth in trastuzumab-containing medium in vitro. These in vitro findings suggest non-cross-resistance between these two agents.

The mechanism of action is unknown but it is likely to act via a similar pathway to risperidone. It has been proposed that the drug's therapeutic activity in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of central dopamine Type 2 (D2) and serotonin Type 2 (5HT2A) receptor antagonism. Paliperidone is also active as an antagonist at alpha 1 and alpha 2 adrenergic receptors and H1 histaminergic receptors, which may explain some of the other effects of the drug. Paliperidone was approved by the FDA for treatment of schizophrenia on December 20, 2006. Paliperidone is the major active metabolite of risperidone. The mechanism of action of paliperidone, as with other drugs having efficacy in schizophrenia, is unknown, but it has been proposed that the drug's therapeutic activity in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of central dopamine Type 2 (D2) and serotonin Type 2 (5HT2A) receptor antagonism. The plasma protein binding of racemic paliperidone is 74%. Paliperidone is an atypical antipsychotic developed by Janssen Pharmaceutica. Chemically, paliperidone is primary active metabolite of the older antipsychotic risperidone (paliperidone is 9-hydroxyrisperidone).

Both drugs naturally occur in in ephedra plant which have a history of use in traditional Eastern medicine and were first researched in the west in 1889. The decongestant effect of pseudoephedrine was described in dogs in 1927. Pseudoephedrine acts mainly as an agonist of alpha adrenergic receptors and less strongly as an agonist of beta adrenergic receptors. This agonism of adrenergic receptors produces vasoconstriction which is used as a decongestant and as a treatment of priapism. Pseudoephedrine is also an inhibitor of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin transporters. -pseudoephedrine is 6.6±0.4% bound to human serum albumin and 22.5±3.2% protein bound in serum. +pseudoephedrine is 6.7±1.2% protein bound to human serum albumin and 25.4±3.9% protein bound in human serum. Pseudoephedrine causes vasoconstriction which leads to a decongestant effect. It has a short duration of action unless formulated as an extended release product. Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of central nervous system stimulation. Pseudoephedrine is a sympathomimetic amine used for its decongestant activity.\"\n",
      "Tacrolimus_(14251),\"Tacrolimus belongs to drug node. Tacrolimus (also FK-506 or Fujimycin) is an immunosuppressive drug whose main use is after organ transplant to reduce the activity of the patient's immune system and so the risk of organ rejection. It is also used in a topical preparation in the treatment of severe atopic dermatitis, severe refractory uveitis after bone marrow transplants, and the skin condition vitiligo. It was discovered in 1984 from the fermentation broth of a Japanese soil sample that contained the bacteria Streptomyces tsukubaensis. Tacrolimus is chemically known as a macrolide. It reduces peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity by binding to the immunophilin FKBP-12 (FK506 binding protein) creating a new complex. This FKBP12-FK506 complex inhibits calcineurin which inhibits T-lymphocyte signal transduction and IL-2 transcription. The mechanism of action of tacrolimus in atopic dermatitis is not known. While the following have been observed, the clinical significance of these observations in atopic dermatitis is not known. It has been demonstrated that tacrolimus inhibits T-lymphocyte activation by first binding to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12. A complex of tacrolimus-FKBP-12, calcium, calmodulin, and calcineurin is then formed and the phosphatase activity of calcineurin is inhibited. This prevents the dephosphorylation and translocation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NF-AT), a nuclear component thought to initiate gene transcription for the formation of lymphokines. Tacrolimus also inhibits the transcription for genes which encode IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, GM-CSF, and TNF-, all of which are involved in the early stages of T-cell activation. Additionally, tacrolimus has been shown to inhibit the release of pre-formed mediators from skin mast cells and basophils, and to downregulate the expression of FceRI on Langerhans cells. ~99% bound to human plasma protein, primarily to albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. This is independent of concentration over a range of 5-50 ng/mL.  Tacrolimus acts by reducing peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity by binding to the immunophilin FKBP-12 (FK506 binding protein) creating a new complex. This inhibits both T-lymphocyte signal transduction and IL-2 transcription. Tacrolimus has similar activity to cyclosporine but rates of rejection are lower with tacrolimus. Tacrolimus has also been shown to be effective in the topical treatment of eczema, particularly atopic eczema. It suppresses inflammation in a similar way to steroids, but is not as powerful. An important dermatological advantage of tacrolimus is that it can be used directly on the face; topical steroids cannot be used on the face, as they thin the skin dramatically there. On other parts of the body, topical steroid are generally a better treatment. For use after allogenic organ transplant to reduce the activity of the patient's immune system and so the risk of organ rejection. It was given FDA approval in 1994 for use in liver transplantation. Since then, this indication has expanded to kidney, heart, small bowel, pancreas, lung, trachea, skin, cornea, and limb transplants. It has also been used in a topical preparation in the treatment of severe atopic dermatitis.\"\n",
      "Quinidine_(14258),\"Quinidine belongs to drug node. An optical isomer of , extracted from the bark of the Cinchona tree and similar plant species. This alkaloid dampens the excitability of cardiac and skeletal muscles by blocking sodium and potassium currents across cellular membranes. It prolongs cellular action potential, and decreases automaticity. Quinidine also blocks muscarinic and alpha-adrenergic neurotransmission. Quinidine acts on sodium channels on the neuronal cell membrane, limiting the spread of seizure activity and reducing seizure propagation. The antiarrhythmic actions are mediated through effects on sodium channels in Purkinje fibers. Quinidine may also act on the slow inward calcium current (ICa), the rapid (IKr) and slow (IKs) components of the delayed potassium rectifier current, the inward potassium rectifier current (IKI), the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (IKATP) and Ito. 80-88% Quinidine, a hydantoin anticonvulsant, is used alone or with phenobarbital or other anticonvulsants to manage tonic-clonic seizures, psychomotor seizures, neuropathic pain syndromes including diabetic neuropathy, digitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiac arrhythmias associated with QT-interval prolongation.

      "Repaglinide_(14259),\"Repaglinide belongs to drug node. Repaglinide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It belongs to the meglitinide class of short-acting insulin secretagogues, which act by binding to β cells of the pancreas to stimulate insulin release. Repaglinide induces an early insulin response to meals decreasing postprandial blood glucose levels. It should only be taken with meals and meal-time doses should be skipped with any skipped meal. Approximately one month of therapy is required before a decrease in fasting blood glucose is seen. Meglitnides may have a neutral effect on weight or cause a slight increase in weight. The average weight gain caused by meglitinides appears to be lower than that caused by sulfonylureas and insulin and appears to occur only in those naïve to oral antidiabetic agents. Due to their mechanism of action, meglitinides may cause hypoglycemia although the risk is thought to be lower than that of sulfonylureas since their action is dependent on the presence of glucose. In addition to reducing postprandial and fasting blood glucose, meglitnides have been shown to decrease glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, which are reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control. Meglitinides appear to be more effective at lowering postprandial blood glucose than metformin, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones. Repaglinide is extensively metabolized in the liver and excreted in bile. Repaglinide metabolites do not possess appreciable hypoglycemic activity. Approximately 90% of a single orally administered dose is eliminated in feces and 8% in urine. Repaglinide activity is dependent on the presence functioning &beta; cells and glucose. In contrast to sulfonylurea insulin secretatogogues, repaglinide has no effect on insulin release in the absence of glucose. Rather, it potentiates the effect of extracellular glucose on ATP-sensitive potassium channel and has little effect on insulin levels between meals and overnight. As such, repaglinide is more effective at reducing postprandial blood glucose levels than fasting blood glucose levels and requires a longer duration of therapy (approximately one month) before decreases in fasting blood glucose are observed. The insulinotropic effects of repaglinide are highest at intermediate glucose levels (3 to 10 mmol/L) and it does not increase insulin release already stimulated by high glucose concentrations (greater than 15 mmol/L). Repaglinide appears to be selective for pancreatic &beta; cells and does not appear to affect skeletal or cardiac muscle or thyroid tissue.  >98% (e.g. to to albumin and &alpha;1-acid glycoprotein) Insulin secretion by pancreatic &beta; cells is partly controlled by cellular membrane potential. Membrane potential is regulated through an inverse relationship between the activity of cell membrane ATP-sensitive potassium channels (ABCC8) and extracellular glucose concentrations. Extracellular glucose enters the cell via GLUT2 (SLC2A2) transporters. Once inside the cell, glucose is metabolized to produce ATP. High concentrations of ATP inhibit ATP-sensitive potassium channels causing membrane depolarization. When extracellular glucose concentrations are low, ATP-sensitive potassium channels open causing membrane repolarization. High glucose concentrations cause ATP-sensitive potassium channels to close resulting in membrane depolarization and opening of L-type calcium channels. The influx of calcium ions stimulates calcium-dependent exocytosis of insulin granules. Repaglinide increases insulin release by inhibiting ATP-sensitive potassium channels in a glucose-dependent manner.  As an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. \"\n",
      "Cyclobenzaprine_(14260),\"Cyclobenzaprine belongs to drug node. Cyclobenzaprine, a centrally-acting muscle relaxant, was first synthesized in 1961 and has been available for human use since 1977. It was initially studied for use as antidepressant given its structural similarity to tricyclic antidepressants - it differs from by only a single double bond. Since its approval, it has remained relatively popular as an adjunctive, short-term treatment for acute skeletal muscle spasms secondary to musculoskeletal injury. The exact mechanism of action of cyclobenzaprine has not been fully elucidated in humans, and much of the information available regarding its mechanism has been ascertained from early animal studies. There is some evidence that cyclobenzaprine exerts its effects at the supraspinal level, specifically within the locus coeruleus of the brainstem, with little-to-no action at neuromuscular junctions or directly on skeletal musculature. Action on the brainstem is thought to result in diminished activity of efferent alpha and gamma motor neurons, likely mediated by inhibition of coeruleus-spinal or reticulospinal pathways, and ultimately depressed spinal cord interneuron activity. Cyclobenzaprine is approximately 93% protein bound in plasma. It has been identified as specifically having a high affinity for human serum albumin. Cyclobenzaprine is a skeletal muscle relaxant that works on areas of the brainstem to reduce skeletal muscle spasm, though its exact pharmacodynamic behaviour is currently unclear. Despite its long half-life, it is relatively short-acting with a typical duration of action of 4-6 hours. Cyclobenzaprine has been reported to contribute to the development of serotonin syndrome when used in combination with other serotonergic medications. Symptoms of serotonin syndrome may include autonomic instability, changes to mental status, neuromuscular abnormalities, or gastrointestinal symptoms - treatment with cyclobenzaprine should be discontinued immediately if any of these reactions occur during therapy. Cyclobenzaprine is indicated as a short-term (2-3 weeks) adjunct therapy, along with rest and physical therapy, for relief of muscle spasm associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. It has not been found effective in the treatment of spasticity originating from cerebral or spinal cord disease, or spasticity in children with cerebral palsy. Cyclobenzaprine is also occasionally used off-label for reducing pain and sleep disturbances in patients with fibromyalgia.\"\n",
      "Fexofenadine_(14266),\"Fexofenadine belongs to drug node. Fexofenadine is an over-the-counter second-generation antihistamine used in the treatment of various allergic symptoms. It is selective for the H<sub>1</sub> receptor, carries little-to-no activity at off-targets, and does not cross the blood-brain barrier - this is in contrast to previous first-generation antihistamines, such as , which readily bind to off-targets that contribute to side effects such as sedation. Fexofenadine is the major active metabolite of and is administered as a racemic mixture in which both etiomers display approximately equivalent antihistamine activity. The H<sub>1</sub> histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to an allergen results in degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H<sub>1</sub> receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes. Fexofenadine is 60-70% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to albumin and α<sub>1</sub>-acid glycoprotein. The extent of protein binding is decreased to 56-68% and 56-75% in patients with renal and hepatic impairment, respectively. Fexofenadine relieves allergy symptoms by antagonizing the actions of histamine, an endogenous compound predomitly responsible for allergic symptomatology. The relatively long duration of action of fexofenadine (approximately 24 hours) allows for once or twice daily dosing, and its rapid absorption allows for an onset of action within 1-3 hours. Fexofenadine should not be taken with fruit juice, as this may impair its absorption. In the United States, fexofenadine is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of allergic rhinitis in patients ≥2 years old and chronic idiopathic urticaria in patients ≥6 months old. In Canada, fexofenadine carries the same indications but is approved only for patients ≥12 years old. Fexofenadine is also available in combination with for the symptomatic treatment of season allergic rhinitis in patients ≥12 years old.\"\n",

It was developed by Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation as part of an effort to develop new hormonal contraceptives with reduced adverse effects. It is commonly formulated with as a combined oral contraceptive that can also be used to treat moderate acne vulgaris. Progesterone analogs like norgestimate decrease the frequency of gonadotropin releasing hormone pulses from the hypothalamus, decreasing follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone. These actions prevent ovulation. 17-desacetylnorgestimate is 97.2% bound to albumin and Norgestrel is >97% protein bound, including 92.5% bound to sex hormone binding globulin. Norgestimate is a progestin that suppresses ovulation for contraception and reduces free testosterone to treat moderate acne vulgaris. The therapeutic index is wide as overdoses are rare. Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of vascular problems, liver disease, hypertension, metabolic effects, headaches, and bleeding irregularities. Norgestimate is formulated with as a combined oral contraceptive.

      "Methylprednisolone_(14269),\"Methylprednisolone belongs to drug node. Methylprednisolone is a derivative glucocorticoid with higher potency than. It was first described in the literature in the late 1950s. The short term effects of corticosteroids are decreased vasodilation and permeability of capillaries, as well as decreased leukocyte migration to sites of inflammation. Corticosteroids binding to the glucocorticoid receptor mediates changes in gene expression that lead to multiple downstream effects over hours to days. Methylprednisolone is 76.8% protein bound in plasma and does not significantly bind to corticosteroid binding protein. Methylprednisolone is bound to human serum albumin in plasma. Corticosteroids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor, inhibiting pro-inflammatory signals, and promoting anti-inflammatory signals. Corticosteroids have a wide therapeutic window as patients may require doses that are multiples of what the body naturally produces. Patients taking corticosteroids should be counselled regarding the risk of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression and increased susceptibility to infections. Oral and intramuscular methylprednisolone are indicated for a number of endocrine, rheumatic, collagen, dermatologic, allergic, ophthalmic, respiratory, hematologic, neoplastic, edematous, gastrointestinal, nervous system, and other disorders. Intra-articular and soft tissue injections are indicated for short term treatment of acute gouty arthritis, acute and subactute bursitis, acute nonspecific tenosynovitis, epicondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and synovitis of osteoarthritis. Intralesional injections are indicated for alopecia areata, discoid lupus erythematosus, keloids, lichen planus, lichen simplex chronicus and psoriatic plaques, necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum, and localized hypertrophic infiltrated inflammatory lesions of granuloma annulare.\"\n",
      "Ethinylestradiol_(14270),\"Ethinylestradiol belongs to drug node. Ethinylestradiol was first synthesized in 1938 by Hans Herloff Inhoffen and Walter Hohlweg at Schering. It was developed in an effort to create an estrogen with greater oral bioavailability. These properties were achieved by the substitution of an ethinyl group at carbon 17 of. Ethinylestradiol soon replaced in contraceptive pills. Ethinylestradiol is a synthetic estrogenic compound. Use of estrogens have a number of effects on the body including reduced bone density. Combined oral contraceptives suppress ovulation by suppressing gonadotrophic hormone, thickening cervical mucus to prevent the travel of sperm, and preventing changes in the endometrium required for implantation of a fertilized egg. Ethinylestradiol decreases luteinizing hormone, decreasing vascularity in the endometrium. It also increases sex hormone binding globulin. Enthinylestradiol is 98.3-98.5% bound to albumin in serum but also exhibits binding to sex hormone binding globulin. Ethinylestradiol is a synthetic estrogen that decreases luteinizing hormone to decrease endometrial vascularization, and decreases gonadotrophic hormone to prevent ovulation. It has a long duration of action as it is taken once daily, and a wide therapeutic index as overdoses are generally not associated with serious adverse effects. Patients should be counselled regarding the risks of thrombotic events. Ethinylestradiol is combined with other drugs for use as a contraceptive, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, moderate acne, moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms of menopause, prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis.\"\n",
      "Formoterol_(14272),\"Formoterol belongs to drug node. Formoterol is an inhaled beta<sub>2</sub>-agonist used in the management of COPD and asthma that was first approved for use in the United States in 2001. It acts on bronchial smooth muscle to dilate and relax airways, and is administered as a racemic mixture of its active (R;R)- and inactive (S;S)-etiomers. A major clinical advantage of formoterol over other inhaled beta-agonists is its rapid onset of action (2-3 minutes), which is at least as fast as , combined with a long duration of action (12 hours) - for this reason, treatment guidelines for asthma recommend its use as both a reliever and maintece medication. It is available as a single-entity product and in several formulations in combination with both inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting muscarinic antagonists. Formoterol is a relatively selective long-acting agonist of beta<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors, although it does carry some degree of activity at beta<sub>1</sub> and beta<sub>3</sub> receptors. Beta<sub>2</sub> receptors are found predomitly in bronchial smooth muscle (with a relatively minor amount found in cardiac tissue) whereas beta<sub>1</sub> receptors are the predomit adrenergic receptors found in the heart - for this reason, selectivity for beta<sub>2</sub> receptors is desirable in the treatment of pulmonary diseases such as COPD and asthma. Formoterol has demonstrated an approximately 200-fold greater activity at beta<sub>2</sub> receptors over beta<sub>1</sub> receptors. Plasma protein binding to serum albumin _in vitro_ is approximately 31%-38% over a plasma concentration range of 5-500 ng/mL - it should be noted, however, that these concentrations are higher than that seen following inhalation. Formoterol works locally in the lungs as a bronchodilator, relaxing smooth muscle and opening up the airways. It possesses both a rapid onset of action (approximately 2-3 minutes) and a long duration of action (up to 12 hours). The use of long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs), such as formoterol, without concomitant inhaled corticosteroids in asthmatic patients should be avoided, as LABA monotherapy has been associated with an increased risk of asthma-related death. Formoterol is indicated in various formulations for the treatment of asthma and COPD. For the treatment of COPD, formoterol is available as a single-entity inhalation solution, in combination with the long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) and , and in combination with the corticosteroid. For the treatment of asthma, formoterol is available in combination with for patients 5 years and older and with budesonide for patients 6 years and older. Formoterol may also be used on an as-needed basis for prophylaxis against exercise-induced bronchospasm.\"\n",

Azathioprine is a prodrug of 6-mercaptopurine, first synthesized in 1956 by Gertrude Elion, William Lange, and George Hitchings in an attempt to produce a derivative of 6-mercaptopurine with a better therapeutic index. Azathioprine is used to treat inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and as an immunosuppressant in the prevention of renal transplant rejection. Azathioprine's mechanism of action is not entirely understood but it may be related to inhibition of purine synthesis, along with inhibition of B and T cells. Azathioprine is 30% bound to proteins such as human serum albumin in circulation. Azathioprine is an immunosuppressive agent which functions through modulation of rac1 to induce T cell apoptosis, as well as other unknown immunosuppressive functions.

      "Doxorubicin_(14275),\"Doxorubicin belongs to drug node. Doxorubicin is a cytotoxic anthracycline antibiotic isolated from cultures of Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius. Doxorubicin binds to nucleic acids, presumably by specific intercalation of the planar anthracycline nucleus with the DNA double helix. Doxorubicin has antimitotic and cytotoxic activity through a number of proposed mechanisms of action: Doxorubicin forms complexes with DNA by intercalation between base pairs, and it inhibits topoisomerase II activity by stabilizing the DNA-topoisomerase II complex, preventing the religation portion of the ligation-religation reaction that topoisomerase II catalyzes. Doxorubicin and its major metabolite, doxorubicinol, is 74-76% bound to plasma protein. The extent to binding is independent of plasma concentration up to 1.1 mcg/mL. Doxorubicin does not cross the blood brain barrier.  Doxorubicin is an antineoplastic in the anthracycline class. General properties of drugs in this class include: interaction with DNA in a variety of different ways including intercalation (squeezing between the base pairs), DNA strand breakage and inhibition with the enzyme topoisomerase II. Most of these compounds have been isolated from natural sources and antibiotics. However, they lack the specificity of the antimicrobial antibiotics and thus produce significant toxicity. The anthracyclines are among the most important antitumor drugs available. Doxorubicin is widely used for the treatment of several solid tumors while daunorubicin and idarubicin are used exclusively for the treatment of leukemia. Doxorubicin may also inhibit polymerase activity, affect regulation of gene expression, and produce free radical damage to DNA. Doxorubicin possesses an antitumor effect against a wide spectrum of tumors, either grafted or spontaneous. The anthracyclines are cell cycle-nonspecific. Doxorubicin is used to produce regression in disseminated neoplastic conditions like acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, Wilms’ tumor, neuroblastoma, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, breast carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, transitional cell bladder carcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, Hodgkin’s disease, maligt lymphoma and bronchogenic carcinoma in which the small cell histologic type is the most responsive compared to other cell types. Doxorubicin is also indicated for use as a component of adjuvant therapy in women with evidence of axillary lymph node involvement following resection of primary breast cancer.\"\n",
      "Letrozole_(14277),\"Letrozole belongs to drug node. Letrozole, or CGS 20267, is an oral non-steroidal type II aromatase inhibitor first described in the literature in 1990. It is a third generation aromatase inhibitor like and , meaning it does not significantly affect cortisol, aldosterone, and thyroxine. Letrozole is a non-steroidal type II aromatase inhibitor. It blocks the active site, and therefore the electron transfer chain of CYP19A1. This competitive inhibition prevents the conversion of androgens to estrogen. This action leads to a reduction in uterine weight and elevated leuteinizing hormone. In postmenopausal women, the action of aromatase is responsible for the majority of estrogen production. With reduced availability of estrogen, estrogen-dependant tumors regress. Third generation aromatase inhibitors do not significantly affect cortisol, aldosterone, and thyroxine levels. Letrozole is 60% bound to proteins. 55% is bound to albumin. Letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor used in the treatment of breast cancer. Aromatase inhibitors work by inhibiting the action of the enzyme aromatase, which converts androgens into estrogens by a process called aromatization. As breast tissue is stimulated by estrogens, decreasing their production is a way of suppressing recurrence of the breast tumor tissue. Letrozole is indicated to treat postmenopausal women with hormone receptor (HR) positive early breast cancer, postmenopausal women with early breast cancer who have periviously been treated with tamoxifen, and postmenopausal women with HR+ or unknown advanced breast cancer. Letrozole, given with ribociclib, is indicated to treat pre, peri, and postmenopausal women with HR+ and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer.\"\n",
      "Ketoprofen_(14278),\"Ketoprofen belongs to drug node. Ketoprofen, a propionic acid derivative, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAIA) with analgesic and antipyretic properties. The anti-inflammatory effects of ketoprofen are believed to be due to inhibition cylooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis via the arachidonic acid pathway. This results in decreased levels of prostaglandins that mediate pain, fever and inflammation. Ketoprofen is a non-specific cyclooxygenase inhibitor and inhibition of COX-1 is thought to confer some of its side effects, such as GI upset and ulceration. Ketoprofen is thought to have anti-bradykinin activity, as well as lysosomal membrane-stabilizing action. Antipyretic effects may be due to action on the hypothalamus, resulting in an increased peripheral blood flow, vasodilation, and subsequent heat dissipation.  99% bound, primarily to albumin Ketoprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAIA) with analgesic and antipyretic properties. Ketoprofen has pharmacologic actions similar to those of other prototypical NSAIDs, which inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. Ketoprofen is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, dysmenorrhea, and alleviate moderate pain. For symptomatic treatment of acute and chronic rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, primary dysmenorrhea and mild to moderate pain associated with musculotendinous trauma (sprains and strains), postoperative (including dental surgery) or postpartum pain.\"\n",

It is typically given to patients who cannot be managed with the standard first line therapy,. Glyburide stimulates insulin secretion through the closure of ATP-sensitive potassium channels on beta cells, raising intracellular potassium and calcium ion concentrations. Glyburide belongs to a class of drugs known as sulfonylureas. These drugs act by closing ATP-sensitive potassium channels on pancreatic beta cells. The ATP-sensitive potassium channels on beta cells are known as sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1). Glyburide is 99.9% bound to protein in plasma with >98% accounted for by binding to serum albumin. Glyburide is a second generation sulfonylurea that stimulates insulin secretion through the closure of ATP-sensitive potassium channels on beta cells, raising intracellular potassium and calcium ion concentrations. Glibenclamide has a long duration of action as it is given once daily, and a wide therapeutic index as patients are started at doses as low as 0.75mg but that can increase as high as 10mg or more. Patients taking glyburide should be cautioned regarding an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality as seen with tolbutamide, another sulfonylurea. Glyburide is indicated alone or as part of combination product with metformin, as an adjunct to diet and exercise, to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\"\n",
      "Ketoconazole_(14281),\"Ketoconazole belongs to drug node. Ketoconazole is an imidazole antifungal agent used in the prevention and treatment of a variety of fungal infections. It functions by preventing the synthesis of ergosterol, the fungal equivalent of cholesterol, thereby increasing membrane fluidity and preventing growth of the fungus. Ketoconazole was first approved in an oral formulation for systemic use by the FDA in 1981. At this time it was considered a significant improvement over previous antifungals, and , due to its broad spectrum and good absorption. However, it was discovered that ketoconazole produces frequent gastrointestinal side effects and dose-related hepatitis. These effects combined with waning efficacy led to its eventual replacement by triazole agents, , , , and. Ketoconazole and its predecessor continue to be used in topical formulations. Ketoconazole interacts with 14-&alpha;-sterol demethylase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme necessary for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol. This results in inhibition of ergosterol synthesis and increased fungal cellular permeability due to reduced amounts of ergosterol present in the fungal cell membrane. This metabolic inhibition also results in accumulation of 14α-methyl-3,6-diol, a toxic metabolite. The increase in membrane fluidity is also thought to produce impairment of membrane-bound enzyme systems as components become less closely packed. Ketoconazole is approximately 84% bound to plasma albumin with another 15% associated with blood cells for a total of 99% binding within the plasma. Ketoconazole, similarly to other azole antifungals, is a fungistatic agent which causes growth arrest in fungal cells thereby preventing growth and spread of the fungus throughout the body.

Ripretinib, also known as Qinlock, is manufactured by Deciphera Pharmaceuticals and was initially approved by the FDA on May 15, 2020.  Protein kinases play important roles in cellular function, and their dysregulation can lead to carcinogenesis. Ripretinib inhibits protein kinases including wild type and mutant platelet-derived growth factor receptor A (PDGFRA) and KIT that cause the majority of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). In vitro, ripretinib has been shown to inhibit PDGFRB, BRAF, VEGF, and TIE2 genes.  Ripretinib is over 99% bound to albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. As a broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor, ripretinib inhibits various gene mutations, increasing progression-free survival in patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). It is effective in treating mutations that are resistant to chemotherapy with other kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib.

      "Risdiplam_(14498),\"Risdiplam belongs to drug node. Risdiplam is an orally bioavailable mRNA splicing modifier used for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). It increases systemic SMN protein concentrations by improving the efficiency of _SMN2_ gene transcription. This mechanism of action is similar to its predecessor , the biggest difference being their route of administration: nusinersen requires intrathecal administration, as does the one-time gene therapy , whereas risdiplam offers the ease of oral bioavailability. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe and progressive congenital neuromuscular disease resulting from mutations in the survival of motor neuron 1 (_SMN1_) gene responsible for making SMN proteins. Clinical features of SMA include degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord which ultimately leads to muscular atrophy and, in some cases, loss of physical strength. SMN proteins are expressed ubiquitously throughout the body and are thought to hold diverse intracellular roles in DNA repair, cell signaling, endocytosis, and autophagy. A secondary _SMN_ gene (_SMN2_) can also produce SMN proteins, but a small nucleotide substitution in its sequence results in the exclusion of exon 7 during splicing in approximately 85% of the transcripts - this means that only ~15% of the SMN proteins produced by _SMN2_ are functional, which is insufficient to compensate for the deficits caused by _SMN1_ mutations. Emerging evidence suggests that many cells and tissues are selectively vulnerable to reduced SMN concentrations, making this protein a desirable target in the treatment of SMA. Risdiplam is approximately 89% protein-bound in plasma, primarily to serum albumin. Risdiplam helps to alleviate symptoms of spinal muscular atrophy by stimulating the production of a critical protein in which these patients are deficient. Early trials with risdiplam demonstrated up to a 2-fold increase in SMN protein concentration in SMA patients after 12 weeks of therapy. Risdiplam is indicated for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in patients 2 months of age and older.\"\n",
      "Elexacaftor_(14499),\"Elexacaftor belongs to drug node. Elexacaftor (previously VX-445) is a small molecule, next-generation corrector of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. It received FDA approval in October 2019 in combination with and as the combination product Trikafta<sup>TM</sup>. Elexacaftor is considered a next-generation CFTR corrector as it possesses both a different structure and mechanism as compared to first generation correctors like tezacaftor. While dual corrector/potentiator combination therapy has proven useful in the treatment of a subset of CF patients, their use is typically limited to patients who are homozygous for the _F508del-CFTR_ gene. Elexacaftor, along with , was designed to fill the need for an efficacious CF therapy for patients who are heterozygous for _F508del-CFTR_ and a gene that does not produce protein or produces proteins unresponsive to ivacaftor or tezacaftor. The triple combination product Trikafta<sup>TM</sup>, manufactured by Vertex Pharmaceuticals, is the first product approved for the treatment of CF in individuals who are either homo- _or_ heterozygous for the _F508del-CFTR_ gene - this represents approximately 70-90% of all CF patients. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the result of a mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The CFTR proteins produced by this gene are transmembrane ion channels that move sodium and chloride across cell membranes - water follows the flow of chloride ions to the cell surface, which consequently helps to hydrate the surface of the cell and thin the secretions (i.e. mucous) around the cell. Mutations in the CFTR gene produce CFTR proteins of insufficient quantity and/or function, leading to defective ion transport and a build-up of thick mucous throughout the body that causes multi-organ disease involving the pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and pancreatic systems (amongst others). The most common CFTR mutation, the _F508del_ mutation, is estimated to account for 70 to 90% of all CFTR mutations and results in severe processing and trafficking defects of the CFTR protein. Elexacaftor is >99% protein bound in plasma, primarily to albumin. As a CFTR corrector, elexacaftor works to increase the amount of mature CFTR proteins present on the surface of cells. When used in combination with CFTR potentiators, which enhance the function of cell-surface CFTR proteins, drugs like elexacaftor help to improve a variety of multi-organ cystic fibrosis symptoms, including lung function, nutritional status, and overall quality of life. Trikafta<sup>TM</sup>, the triple combination product containing elexacaftor, may cause elevations in liver transaminases. Liver function testing should be conducted prior to beginning Trikafta, every 3 months for the first year of treatment, and annually thereafter. Elexacaftor, in combination with and as the combination product Trikafta<sup>TM</sup>, is indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients 12 years of age and older who have at least one _F508del_ mutation in the CTFR gene.\"\n",
      "Niacin_(14506),\"Niacin belongs to drug node. Niacin is a B vitamin used to treat vitamin deficiencies as well as hyperlipidemia, dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and to reduce the risk of myocardial infarctions. Niacin performs a number of functions in the body and so has many mechanisms, not all of which have been fully described. Niacin can decrease lipids and apolipoprotein B (apo B)-containing lipoproteins by modulating triglyceride synthesis in the liver, which degrades apo B, or by modulating lipolysis in adipose tissue. Data regarding the protein binding of niacin is not readily available. Niacin is a B vitamin used to treat vitamin deficiencies as well as hyperlipidemia, dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and to reduce the risk of myocardial infarctions. Niacin acts to decrease levels of very low density lipoproteins and low density lipoproteins, while increasing levels of high density lipoproteins. Niacin has a wide therapeutic window with usual oral doses between 500mg and 2000mg. Patients with diabetes, renal failure, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, and elderly patients taking niacin with simvastatin or lovastatin are at increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Niacin is indicated to prevent vitamin deficiencies in pediatric and adult patients receiving parenteral nutrition as part of multivitamin intravenous injections. Niacin oral tablets are indicated as a monotherapy or in combination with simvastatin or lovastatin to treat primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia. It can also be used to reduce the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarctions in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and hyperlipidemia. Niacin is also indicated with bile acid binding resins to treat atherosclerosis in patients with coronary artery disease and hyperlipidemia or to treat primary hyperlipidemia. Finally niacin is indicated to treat severe hypertriglyceridemia.\"\n",
      "Clofibrate_(14507),\"Clofibrate belongs to drug node. A fibric acid derivative used in the treatment of hyperlipoproteinemia type III and severe hypertriglyceridemia. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p986) Clofibrate increases the activity of extrahepatic lipoprotein lipase (LL), thereby increasing lipoprotein triglyceride lipolysis. Chylomicrons are degraded, VLDLs are converted to LDLs, and LDLs are converted to HDL. This is accompanied by a slight increase in secretion of lipids into the bile and ultimately the intestine. Clofibrate also inhibits the synthesis and increases the clearance of apolipoprotein B, a carrier molecule for VLDL. Also, as a fibrate, Clofibrate is an agonist of the PPAR-α receptor in muscle, liver, and other tissues. This agonism ultimately leads to modification in gene expression resulting in increased beta-oxidation, decreased triglyceride secretion, increased HDL, increased lipoprotein lipase activity. Highly protein-bound (95% to 97%). Clofibrate is an antilipidemic agent similar to gemfibrozil. It acts to lower elevated serum lipids by reducing the very low-density lipoprotein fraction (S<sub>f</sub> 20-400) rich in triglycerides. Serum cholesterol may be decreased, particularly in those patients whose cholesterol elevation is due to the presence of IDL as a result of Type III hyperlipoproteinemia. Several investigators have observed in their studies that clofibrate may produce a decrease in cholesterol linoleate but an increase in palmitoleate and oleate, the latter being considered atherogenic in experimental animals. The significance of this finding is unknown at this time. Reduction of triglycerides in some patients treated with clofibrate or certain of its chemically and clinically similar analogs may be associated with an increase in LDL cholesterol. Increase in LDL cholesterol has been observed in patients whose cholesterol is initially normal. Animal studies suggest that clofibrate interrupts cholesterol biosynthesis prior to mevalonate formation. For Primary Dysbetalipoproteinemia (Type III hyperlipidemia) that does not respond adequately to diet. This helps control high cholesterol and high triglyceride levels. \"\n",
      "Danazol_(14528),\"Danazol belongs to drug node. A synthetic steroid with antigonadotropic and anti-estrogenic activities that acts as an anterior pituitary suppressant by inhibiting the pituitary output of gonadotropins. It possesses some androgenic properties. Danazol has been used in the treatment of endometriosis and some benign breast disorders. As a gonadotropin inhibitor, danazol suppresses the pituitary-ovarian axis possibly by inhibiting the output of pituitary gonadotropins. Danazol also depresses the preovulatory surge in output of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), thereby reducing ovarian estrogen production. Danazol may also directly inhibits ovarian steroidogenesis; bind to androgen, progesterone, and glucocorticoid receptors; bind to sex-hormone-binding globulin and corticosteroid-binding globulin; and increases the metabolic clearance rate of progesterone. Another mechanism of action by which danazol may use to facilitate regression of endometriosis is by decreasing IgG, IgM, and IgA concentrations, as well as phospholipid and IgG isotope autoantibodies. In the treatment of endometriosis, as a consequence of suppression of ovarian function, danazol causes both normal and ectopic endometrial tissues to become inactive and atrophic. This leads to anovulation and associated amenorrhea. In fibrocystic breast disease, the exact mechanism of action of danazol is unknown, but may be related to suppressed estrogenic stimulation as a result of decreased ovarian production of estrogen. A direct effect on steroid receptor sites in breast tissue is also possible. This leads to a disappearance of nodularity, relief of pain and tenderness, and possibly changes in the menstrual pattern. In terms of hereditary angioedema, danazol corrects the underlying biochemical deficiency by increasing serum concentrations of the deficient C1 esterase inhibitor, resulting in increased serum concentrations of the C4 component of the complement system. (Source: PharmGKB)  Danazol is a derivative of the synthetic steroid ethisterone, a modified testosterone. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the first drug to specifically treat endometriosis, but its role as a treatment for endometriosis has been largely replaced by the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. Danazol has antigonadotropic and anti-estrogenic activities. Danazol acts as an anterior pituitary suppressant by inhibiting the pituitary output of gonadotropins.

      "Ranolazine_(14537),\"Ranolazine belongs to drug node. Chronic angina is a common cardiovascular condition affecting millions worldwide and causes significant disability while interfering with daily activities. Ranolazine is a well-tolerated piperazine derivative used for the management of this condition, offering relief from uncomfortable and debilitating symptoms. With a mechanism of action different from drugs used to treat the same condition, ranolazine is a promising anti-anginal therapy. It was originally approved by the FDA in 2006. Myocardial ischemia exerts effects on adenosine triphosphate flux, leading to a decrease in the energy available for contraction and relaxation of the heart muscle. Electrolyte balance of sodium and potassium is necessary for maintaining normal cardiac contraction and relaxation. Disruption of adequate sodium and potassium electrolyte balance leads to excessively high concentrations of sodium and calcium, which likely interferes with oxygen supply to the heart muscle. This imbalance eventually leads to angina symptoms of chest pain or pressure, nausea, and dizziness, among others. Approximately 62% of the administered dose of ranolazine is bound to plasma proteins. Ranolazine appears to have a higher binding affinity for alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Ranolazine exerts both antianginal and ischemic effects independent from lowering heart rate or blood pressure. It blocks IKr, the rapid portion of the delayed rectifier potassium current, and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-dependent fashion. The Ikr is important for cardiac repolarization. Ranolazine exerts its therapeutic effects without negative chronotropic, dromotropic, or inotropic actions neither at rest, nor during exercise. Ranolazine is indicated for the treatment of chronic angina. It can be used alone or in conjunction with nitrates, beta-blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, anti-platelet drugs, calcium channel blockers, lipid-lowering drugs, and ACE inhibitors.\"\n",
      "Prazosin_(14539),\"Prazosin belongs to drug node. Prazosin, also known as _Minipress_, is a drug used to treat hypertension. Prazosin is marketed by _Pfizer_ and was initially approved by the FDA in 1988. It belongs to the class of drugs known as alpha-1 antagonists ,.  Alpha-adrenergic receptors are essential for the regulation of blood pressure in humans. Two types of alpha receptors, alpha 1 and alpha 2, both play a role in regulating blood pressure. Alpha-1 receptors are postsynaptic (located after the nerve junction, or space between a nerve fiber and target tissue). In this case, the target tissue is the vascular smooth muscle. These receptors, when activated, increase blood pressure.  Highly bound to proteins with 97% binding to albumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. Prazosin is thought to be mostly (about 80-90%) bound to albumin. **Effects on blood pressure** This drug is indicated for the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure). Prazosin can be given alone or given with other blood pressure-lowering drugs, including diuretics or beta-adrenergic blocking agents.\"\n",
      "Desipramine_(14543),\"Desipramine belongs to drug node. Desipramine hydrochloride is a dibenzazepine-derivative tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). TCAs are structurally similar to phenothiazines. They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, desipramine does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, desipramine exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Secondary amine TCAs, such as desipramine and nortriptyline, are more potent inhibitors of norepinephrine reuptake than tertiary amine TCAs, such as amitriptyline and doxepine. TCAs also down-regulate cerebral cortical &beta;-adrenergic receptors and sensitize post-synaptic serotonergic receptors with chronic use. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. TCAs also block histamine-H<sub>1</sub> receptors, &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively. See toxicity section below for a complete listing of side effects. Desipramine exerts less anticholinergic and sedative side effects compared to tertiary amine TCAs, such as amitriptyline and clomipramine. Desipramine may be used to treat depression, neuropathic pain (unlabeled use), agitation and insomnia (unlabeled use) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (unlabeled use). Desipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that selectively blocks reuptake of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) from the neuronal synapse. It also inhibits serotonin reuptake, but to a lesser extent compared to tertiary amine TCAs such as imipramine. Inhibition of neurotransmitter reuptake increases stimulation of the post-synaptic neuron. Chronic use of desipramine also leads to down-regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors in the cerebral cortex and sensitization of serotonergic receptors. An overall increase in serotonergic transmission likely confers desipramine its antidepressant effects. Desipramine also possesses minor anticholinergic activity, through its affinity for muscarinic receptors. TCAs are believed to act by restoring normal levels of neurotransmitters via synaptic reuptake inhibition and by increasing serotonergic neurotransmission via serotonergic receptor sensitization in the central nervous system. 73-92% bound to plasma proteins Desipramine, a secondary amine tricyclic antidepressant, is structurally related to both the skeletal muscle relaxant cyclobenzaprine and the thioxanthene antipsychotics such as thiothixene. It is the active metabolite of imipramine, a tertiary amine TCA. The acute effects of desipramine include inhibition of noradrenaline re-uptake at noradrenergic nerve endings and inhibition of serotonin (5-hydroxy tryptamine, 5HT) re-uptake at the serotoninergic nerve endings in the central nervous system. Desipramine exhibits greater noradrenergic re-uptake inhibition compared to the tertiary amine TCA imipramine. In addition to inhibiting neurotransmitter re-uptake, desipramine down-regulates beta-adrenergic receptors in the cerebral cortex and sensitizes serotonergic receptors with chronic use. The overall effect is increased serotonergic transmission. Antidepressant effects are typically observed 2 - 4 weeks following the onset of therapy though some patients may require up to 8 weeks of therapy prior to symptom improvement. Patients experiencing more severe depressive episodes may respond quicker than those with mild depressive symptoms. For relief of symptoms in various depressive syndromes, especially endogenous depression. It has also been used to manage chronic peripheral neuropathic pain, as a second line agent for the management of anxiety disorders (e.g. panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder), and as a second or third line agent in the ADHD management. \"\n",
      "Clindamycin_(14545),\"Clindamycin belongs to drug node. Clindamycin is a semi-synthetic lincosamide antibiotic used in the treatment of a variety of serious infections due to susceptible microorganisms as well as topically for acne vulgaris. It has a relatively narrow spectrum of activity that includes anaerobic bacteria as well as gram-positive cocci and bacilli and gram-negative bacilli. Interestingly, clindamycin appears to carry some activity against protozoans, and has been used off-label in the treatment of toxoplasmosis, malaria, and babesiosis. Clindamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to 23S RNA of the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome. It impedes both the assembly of the ribosome and the translation process. The molecular mechanism through which this occurs is thought to be due to clindamycin's three-dimensional structure, which closely resembles the 3'-ends of L-Pro-Met-tRNA and deacylated-tRNA during the peptide elongation cycle - in acting as a structural analog of these tRNA molecules, clindamycin impairs peptide chain initiation and may stimulate dissociation of peptidyl-tRNA from bacterial ribosomes. Clindamycin protein binding is concentration-dependent and ranges from 60-94%. It is bound primarily to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein in the serum. Clindamycin exerts its bacteriostatic effect via inhibition of microbial protein synthesis. Clindamycin has a relatively short T<sub>max</sub> and half-life necessitating administration every six hours to ensure adequate antibiotic concentrations.  In oral and parenteral formulations, clindamycin is indicated for the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria, as well as susceptible staphylococci, streptococci, and pneumococci. Used topically, it is indicated for the treatment of acne vulgaris and is available in combination with or for this purpose.

      "Metoclopramide_(14546),\"Metoclopramide belongs to drug node. Diabetic gastroparesis is a condition that causes frequent nausea and vomiting, which has a negative impact on quality of life and poses a significant burden on the healthcare system. Metoclopramide is a dopamine antagonist used to treat nausea and vomiting that may be associated with diabetic gastroparesis in addition to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It can also be used to prevent nausea or vomiting associated with chemotherapy or certain surgical or diagnostic procedures.  Metoclopramide causes antiemetic effects by inhibiting dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT3 receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) located in the area postrema of the brain. Administration of this drug leads to prokinetic effects via inhibitory actions on presynaptic and postsynaptic D2 receptors, agonism of serotonin 5-HT4 receptors, and antagonism of muscarinic receptor inhibition. This action enhances the release of acetylcholine, causing increased lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and gastric tone, accelerating gastric emptying and transit through the gut. Metoclopramide antagonizes the dopamine D2 receptors. Dopamine exerts relaxant effect on the gastrointestinal tract through binding to muscular D2 receptors. Metoclopramide is 30% bound to plasma proteins, mainly to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Metoclopramide increases gastric emptying by decreasing lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure. It also exerts effects on the area postrema of the brain, preventing and relieving the symptoms of nausea and vomiting. In addition, this drug increases gastrointestinal motility without increasing biliary, gastric, or pancreatic secretions. Metoclopramide in the oral tablet form is used for symptomatic treatment of both acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis, in addition to the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in patients who have failed to respond to traditional therapy. A nasal spray formulation is also indicated to treat adults with acute, recurrent diabetic gastroparesis.\"\n",

      "Canagliflozin_(14551),\"Canagliflozin belongs to drug node. Canagliflozin, also known as _Invokana_, is a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor used in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus along with lifestyle changes including diet and exercise. The sodium-glucose co-transporter2 (SGLT2), is found in the proximal tubules of the kidney, and reabsorbs filtered glucose from the renal tubular lumen. Canagliflozin inhibits the SGLT2 co-transporter. This inhibition leads to lower reabsorption of filtered glucose into the body and decreases the renal threshold for glucose (RTG), leading to increased glucose excretion in the urine.  Canagliflozin is mainly bound to albumin. The plasma protein binding of this drug is 99%. This drug increases urinary glucose excretion and decreases the renal threshold for glucose (RTG) in a dose-dependent manner. The renal threshold is defined as the lowest level of blood glucose associated with the appearance of detectable glucose in the urine. The end result of canagliflozin administration is increased urinary excretion of glucose and less renal absorption of glucose, decreasing glucose concentration in the blood and improving glycemic control.  This drug is used in conjunction with diet and exercise to increase glycemic control in adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\"\n",

These indications are based on response rate. Clinical benefit such as improvement in overall survival has not been demonstrated. Romidepsin is a prodrug, where it becomes active once taken up into the cell. The active metabolite has a free thiol group, which interacts with zinc ions in the active site of class 1 and 2 HDAC enzymes, resulting in inhibition of its enzymatic activity. Certain tumors have over expressed HDACs and downregulated/mutated histone acetyltransferases. This imbalance of HDAC relative to histone acetyltransferase can lead to a decrease in regulatory genes, ensuing tumorigenesis. Inhibition of HDAC may restore normal gene expression in cancer cells and result in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

      "Rivaroxaban_(15010),\"Rivaroxaban belongs to drug node. Rivaroxaban is an anticoagulant and the first orally active direct factor Xa inhibitor. Unlike warfarin, routine lab monitoring of INR is not necessary. However there is no antidote available in the event of a major bleed. Only the 10 mg tablet can be taken without regard to food. The 15 mg and 20 mg tablet should be taken with food. FDA approved on July 1, 2011. Rivaroxaban competitively inhibits free and clot bound factor Xa. Factor Xa is needed to activate prothrombin (factor II) to thrombin (factor IIa). Thrombin is a serine protease that is required to activate fibrinogen to fibrin, which is the loose meshwork that completes the clotting process. Since one molecule of factor Xa can generate more than 1000 molecules of thrombin, selective inhibitors of factor Xa are profoundly useful in terminating the amplification of thrombin generation. The action of rivaroxaban is irreversible. Plasma protein binding is about 92% to 95% Rivaroxaban is an anticoagulant which binds directly to factor Xa. Thereafter, it effectively blocks the amplification of the coagulation cascade, preventing the formation of thrombus. Rivaroxaban is a unqiue anticoagulant for two reasons. First of all, it is does not involve antithrombin III (ATIII) to exert its anticoagulant effects. Secondly, it is an oral agent whereas the widely used unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparins are for parenteral use only. Although the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and HepTest (a test developed to assay low molecular weight heparins) are prolonged in a dose-dependant manner, neither test is recommended for the assessment of the pharmacodynamic effects of rivaroxaban. Anti-Xa activity and inhibition of anti-Xa activity monitoring is also not recommended despite being influenced by rivaroxaban. Rivaroxaban is indicated for the prevention of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in patients who have undergone total hips replacements and total knee replacement surgery; prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation; treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE); to reduce risk of recurrent DVT and/or PE. Rivaroxaban is also indicated, in combination with aspirin, for reducing the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with chronic coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease. Due to a lack of safety studies, it is not recommended for use in those under 18 years old. Its use is also not recommended in those with severe renal impairment (<30mL/min).\"\n",

It was developed by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals under the trade name Torisel. Temsirolimus was approved by the FDA in late May 2007 as well as the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) on November 2007. Temsirolimus is an inhibitor of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). Temsirolimus binds to an intracellular protein (FKBP-12), and the protein-drug complex inhibits the activity of mTOR that controls cell division. Inhibition of mTOR activity resulted in a G1 growth arrest in treated tumor cells. When mTOR was inhibited, its ability to phosphorylate p70S6k and S6 ribosomal protein, which are downstream of mTOR in the PI3 kinase/AKT pathway was blocked. In in vitro studies using renal cell carcinoma cell lines, temsirolimus inhibited the activity of mTOR and resulted in reduced levels of the hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1 and HIF-2 alpha, and the vascular endothelial growth factor. 87% bound to plasma proteins <i>in vitro</i> at a concentration of 100 ng/ml  For the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

      "Ambrisentan_(15014),\"Ambrisentan belongs to drug node. Ambrisentan is an orally active selective type A endothelin receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. It is approved in Europe, Canada and the United States for use as a single agent to improve exercise ability and delay clinical worsening. In addition, it is approved in the United States for use in combination with tadalafil to reduce the risks of disease progression, hospitalization and to improve exercise ability. Studies establishing the efficacy of Ambrisentan included patients with both idiopathic or heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension and those with pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with connective tissue diseases. Patients studied displayed symptoms and etiologies predomitly of WHO Functional Class II-III. As an endothelin receptor antagonist, Ambrisentan prevents endogenous endothelin peptide from constricting the muscles in blood vessels, allowing them to relax and permit a reduction in blood pressure. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is an endogenous peptide that acts on the endothelin type A (ETA) and endothelin type B (ETB) receptors in vascular smooth muscle and endothelium. ETA-mediated actions include vasoconstriction and cell proliferation, whereas ETB predomitly mediates vasodilation, anti-proliferation, and ET-1 clearance. In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, ET-1 levels are increased and correlate with increased right arterial pressure and severity of disease. Ambrisentan is 99% plasma protein bound, primarily to albumin (96.5%) and to a lesser degree alpha1-acid glycoprotein. Ambrisentan 10 mg daily had no significant effect on the QTc interval, whereas a 40 mg daily dose of ambrisentan increased mean QTc at tmax by 5 ms with an upper 95% confidence limit of 9 ms. Significant QTc prolongation is not expected in patients taking ambrisentan without concomitant metabolic inhibitors.  Ambrisentan is indicated for treatment of idiopathic (‘primary’) pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) associated with connective tissue disease in patients with WHO functional class II or III symptoms. In the United States of America, ambrisentan is also indicated in combination with tadalafil to reduce the risks of disease progression and hospitalization for worsening PAH, and to improve exercise ability.\"\n",
      "Cethromycin_(15016),\"Cethromycin belongs to drug node. Cethromycin is a 3-keto (ketolide) derivative of erythromycin A with an 11,12-carbamate group and an O-6-linked aromatic ring system. Cethromycin represents a joint development effort by Abbott Laboratories, Taisho Pharmaceuticals, and Advanced Life Sciences, intended to be marketed under the trade name Restanza for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. However, after completing phase III clinical trials, it was deemed safe but not sufficiently efficacious by the FDA. Respiratory tract infections can be caused by numerous strains of bacteria, requiring careful consideration of treatment and antibiotics effective against a broad spectrum of potential pathogens. Cethromycin, like other macrolide antibiotics, binds to the 23S rRNA of the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome. This binding, primarily mediated through regions II and V of the rRNA, occludes the peptide exit tunnel and inhibits bacterial protein synthesis. In addition, cethromycin is capable of binding to ribosomal intermediates during ribosome biogenesis, inhibiting the formation of functional 70S bacterial ribosomes. Due to the sequence and structural similarity of ribosomes between species, cethromycin displays broad-spectrum activity against diverse Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and atypical bacteria. Cethromycin displays 86.7 to 95.6% human plasma protein binding over a range of concentrations between 0.1 to 30.0 μg/ml. Cethromycin binds to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome to inhibit both ribosome assembly and bacterial protein synthesis. Adverse effects such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and headache may be due to off-target inhibition of molecules within mammalian cells. Cethromycin currently has no FDA-approved indications; it was granted orphan drug designation for the prophylactic treatment of inhalation anthrax in 2007 and for the prophylactic treatment of both plague due to _Yersinia pestis_ and tularemia due to _Francisella tularensis_ in 2009.\"\n",
      "Lonafarnib_(15017),\"Lonafarnib belongs to drug node. Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare autosomal domit disorder estimated to affect approximately one in 20 million individuals resulting in adverse symptoms associated with premature ageing: skeletal dysplasia, joint contractures, atherosclerosis, myocardial fibrosis/dysfunction, scleroderma-like cutaneous effects, lipoatrophy, alopecia, and a severe failure to thrive; HGPS is uniformly fatal. Mechanistically, HGPS is underpinned by a single heterozygous C-to-T mutation at position 1824 of the _LMNA_ gene, which results in the accumulation of an aberrant farnesylated form of lamin A called progerin in the inner nuclear membrane. Lonafarnib is a farnesyl transferase (FTase) inhibitor (FTI), which reduces the farnesylation of numerous cellular proteins, including progerin; as progerin farnesylation is important for localization to the nuclear membrane, lonafarnib inhibits progerin accumulation and improves symptoms in HGPS patients. Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare autosomal domit disorder estimated to affect approximately one in 20 million individuals resulting in premature ageing, associated cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and musculoskeletal effects and early death around 14 years of age. The _LMNA_ gene encodes lamin A and lamin C, two proteins involved in nuclear integrity and function at the inner nuclear membrane. Under normal conditions, the 12-exon _LMNA_ gene produces full-length prelamin A, which undergoes farnesylation of the C-terminal _CaaX_ motif, followed by proteolytic cleavage of the terminal three amino acids (_aaX_) by the metalloproteinase ZMPSTE24, subsequent carboxymethylation, and finally removal of the last 15 amino acids to yield mature, unfarnesylated, lamin A protein. In HGPS, a single heterozygous C-to-T mutation at position 1824 results in a cryptic splice site that removes the last 150 nucleotides of exon 11 and a concomitant 50-amino acid deletion in the C-terminus of the prelamin A protein. This aberrant prelamin A protein, often called progerin, is permanently farnesylated but unable to complete maturation due to the removal of the second endoproteolytic cleavage site. Lonafarnib exhibits _in vitro_ plasma protein binding of ≥99% over a concentration range of 0.5-40.0 μg/mL. Lonafarnib is a direct farnesyl transferase inhibitor that reduces the farnesylation of numerous cellular proteins, including progerin, the aberrantly truncated form of lamin A that accumulates in progeroid laminopathies such as Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. Treatment with lonafarnib has been associated with electrolyte abnormalities, myelosuppression, and increased liver enzyme levels (AST/ALT), although causation remains unclear. Also, lonafarnib is known to cause nephrotoxicity in rats and rod-dependent low-light vision decline in monkeys at plasma levels similar to those achieved under recommended dosing guidelines in humans; patients taking lonafarnib should undergo regular monitoring for both renal and ophthalmological function. In addition, based on observations from animal studies with rats, monkeys, and rabbits with plasma drug concentrations approximately equal to those attained in humans, lonafarnib may cause both male and female fertility impairment and embryo-fetal toxicity. Lonafarnib is a farnesyltransferase inhibitor indicated in patients aged 12 months and older with a body surface area of at least 0.39 m<sup>2</sup> to reduce the risk of mortality associated with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). It is also indicated in this same population for the treatment of processing-deficient progeroid laminopathies that either involve a heterozygous _LMNA_ mutation resulting in the accumulation of a progerin-like protein or homozygous/compound heterozygous mutations in _ZMPSTE24_.\"\n",

Boceprevir is a direct acting antiviral medication used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as Boceprevir. Boceprevir is an inhibitor of NS3/4A, a serine protease enzyme, encoded by HCV genotypes 1 and 4. These enzymes are essential for viral replication and serve to cleave the virally encoded polyprotein into mature proteins like NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B. The barrier for develoment of resistance to NS3/4A inhibitors is lower than that of NS5B inhibitors, another class of DAAs. Subtitutions at amino acid positions 155, 156, or 168 are known to confer resistance. The substitutions of the enzyme's catalytic triad consisting of H58, D82, and S139 are also likely to alter the affinity of the drug for NS3/4A or the activity of the enzyme itself. Despite this disadvantage Boceprevir is still effective against HCV when paired with , , and. Boceprevir is a NS3/4a protease inhibitor used to inhibit viral HCV replication. NS3/4a protease is an integral part of viral replication and mediates the cleavage the virally encoded polyprotein to mature proteins (NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B). Boceprevir covalently but reversibly binds the serine (S139) resiude in the active site via a (α)-ketoamide functional group. This inhibits the proteolytic acitvity of the HCV 1a and 1b encoded enzyme. Bocepravir is approximately 75% bound to human plasma proteins following a single dose.

It is marketed under the name DAKLINZA and is contained in daily oral tablets as the hydrochloride salt form. Hepatitis C is an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients. Daclatasvir was the first drug with demonstrated safety and therapeutic efficacy in treating HCV genotype 3 without the need for co-administration of interferon or. It exerts its antiviral action by preventing RNA replication and virion assembly via binding to NS5A, a nonstructural phosphoprotein encoded by HCV. Binding to the N-terminus of the D1 domain of NS5A prevents its interaction with host cell proteins and membranes required for virion replication complex assembly. Daclatasvir is shown to target both the cis- and trans-acting functions of NS5A and disrupts the function of new HCV replication complexes by modulating the NS5A phosphorylation status. The most common critical NS5A amino acid substitutions that led to reduced susceptibility to daclatasvir therapy occured at position Q30 (Q30H/K/R) and M28 in genotype 1a patients and Y93H in genotype 3 patients.  NS5A is a viral nonstructural phospoprotein that is part of a functional replication complex in charge of viral RNA genome amplification on endoplasmic reticulum membranes. It has the ability to bind to HCV RNA. It is shown to have two distinct functions in HCV RNA replication based on phosphorylated states. Maintaining the HCV replication complex is mediated by the cis-acting function of basally phosphorylated NS5A and the trans-acting function of hyperphosphorylated NS5A modulates HCV assembly and infectious particle formation. Daclatasvir is shown to disrupt hyperphosphorylated NS5A proteins thus interfere with the function of new HCV replication complexes. It is also reported that daclatasvir also blocks both intracellular viral RNA synthesis and virion assembly/secretion in vivo.  Daclatasvir is highly protein bound (99%). Daclatasvir is a direct-acting antiviral agent that targets the NS5A and causes a decrease in serum HCV RNA levels. It disrupts HCV replication by specifically inhibiting the critical functions of an NS5A protein in the replication complex. It is shown to cause downregulation of the hyperphosphorylation of NS5A. It does not appear to prolong the QT interval even when given at 3 times the maximum recommended dose.  Indicated for use with sofosbuvir, with or without ribavirin, for the treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1a/b or 3 infection. The dosing regimen of 60mg daclatasvir 60 mg with 400mg sofosbuvir once a day is recommended for both genontypes. \"\n",

      "Copper_(14012),\"Copper belongs to drug node. Copper is a transition metal and a trace element in the body. It is important to the function of many enzymes including cytochrome c oxidase, monoamine oxidase and superoxide dismutase. Copper is commonly used in contraceptive intrauterine devices (IUD). Copper is absorbed from the gut via high affinity copper uptake protein and likely through low affinity copper uptake protein and natural resistance-associated macrophage protein-2. It is believed that copper is reduced to the Cu1+ form prior to transport. Once inside the enterocyte, it is bound to copper transport protein ATOX1 which shuttles the ion to copper transporting ATPase-1 on the golgi membrane which take up copper into the golgi apparatus. Once copper has been secreted by enterocytes into the systemic circulation it remain largely bound by ceruloplasmin (65-90%), albumin (18%), and alpha 2-macroglobulin (12%).  Copper is nearly entirely bound by ceruloplasmin (65-90%), plasma albumin (18%), and alpha 2-macroglobulin (12%).

      "Medrysone_(14016),\"Medrysone belongs to drug node. Medrysone is a corticosteroid used in ophthalmology. There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. Initially, the drug binds to the glucocorticoid receptor in the cytosol. This migrates to the nucleus and binds to genetic elements which cause activation and repression of the involved genes in the inflammatory pathway.  Medrysone is a topical anti-inflammatory corticoidsteroids for ophthalmic use. In patients with increased intraocular pressure and in those susceptible to a rise in intraocular pressure, there is less effect on pressure with medrysone than with dexamethasone or betamethasone. Corticoidsteroids inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, and phagocytic migration of the acute inflammatory response, as well as capillary proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation.

      "Beclomethasone dipropionate_(14018),\"Beclomethasone dipropionate belongs to drug node. Beclomethasone dipropionate is a second-generation synthetic corticosteroid agent and a diester of beclomethasone, which is structurally similar to. It is a prodrug of an active metabolite beclomethasone 17-monopropionate (17-BMP) which acts on the glucocorticoid receptor to mediates its therapeutic action. Beclomethasone dipropionate itself posesses weak glucocorticoid receptor binding affinity and is rapidly converted into 17-BMP upon administration. Formulations for oral inhalation, intranasal, and topical use are available for beclomethasone dipropionate. Beclomethasone dipropionate became first available in a pressurized metered-dose inhaler in 1972 and later in a dry powder inhaler and an aqueous nasal spray. Due to its anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and anti-allergy properties, beclomethasone dipropionate is used in various inflammatory conditions, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and dermatoses to reduce symptoms. When inhaled, it is proposed that beclomethasone dipropionate remains active locally in the lung without causing significant side effects associated with systemic corticosteroids. Compared to earlier corticosteroids such as and , beclomethasone dipropionate is reported to be less irritating to the nasal mucosa with a longer duration of action when administered intranasally. Beclomethasone dipropionate is a corticosteroid and prodrug that is rapidly activated by hydrolysis to the active monoester, 17 monopropionate (17-BMP), which mediates anti-inflammatory actions. 17-BMP has been shown _in vitro_ to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor which is approximately 13 times that of dexamethasone and 25 times that of beclomethasone dipropionate. Upon binding of the ligand, the glucocorticoid receptors dimerize and translocate into the nucleus, where they subsequently bind to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) on glucocorticoid-responsive genes, leading to changes in transcription. There are several proposed mechanisms for the anti-inflammatory action of corticosteroids. Corticosteroids may work by increasing the transcription of genes coding for anti-inflammatory proteins, including lipocortin-1 and interleukin-10. Corticosteroids were also shown to inhibit the expression of multiple genes that encode pro-inflammatory factors, such as cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules, that are activated during the chronic inflammatory process. This is thought to be due to the direct inhibitory interaction between activated glucocorticoid receptors and activated pro-inflammatory transcription factors, such as nuclear factor-kappa B and activator protein-1. Chronic inflammation is often characterized by enhanced expression of these transcription factors that bind to and activate coactivator molecules, which then acetylate core histones to switch on gene transcription to further amplify the inflammatory process. Corticosteroids suppress the multiple inflammatory gene expression by promoting histone deacetylation, resulting in tighter coiling of DNA and reduced access of transcription factors to their binding sites.  Based on the findings of _in vitro_ studies, the protein binding of the main active metabolite, beclomethasone-17-monopropionate (17-BMP), was 94-96% over the concentration range of 1000 to 5000 pg/mL. Inflammatory conditions, including asthma, dermatoses, and allergic rhinitis, involve the activation of cascades by inflammatory mediators. Inflammation is a primary defense mechanism and the homeostatic response of the immune system; however, a prolonged inflammatory response in certain disorders may lead to tissue damage, pain, and swelling. Beclomethasone dipropionate works by attenuating the inflammatory responses associated with asthma, allergic rhinitis, nasal polyps, and corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. It suppresses the actions of inflammatory cells, such as mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. It also inhibits the release of inflammatory mediators, such as histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines. Beclomethasone dipropionate is reported to exhibit potent topical activity while possessing low systemic effects.  Indicated for oral inhalation use in the maintece treatment of asthma as prophylactic therapy in patients 5 years of age and older. The aerosol form of beclomethasone diproprionate is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.\"\n",

It can be used topically to manage inflammatory skin conditions such as eczema, and parenterally to manage several disease states including autoimmune disorders. Betamethasone has potent glucocorticoid activity and negligible mineralocorticoid activity. Glucocorticoids inhibit neutrophil apoptosis and demargination, and inhibit NF-Kappa B and other inflammatory transcription factors. They also inhibit phospholipase A2, leading to decreased formation of arachidonic acid derivatives. In addition, glucocorticoids promote anti-inflammatory genes like interleukin-10. Betamethasone valerate binds to serum albumin and corticosteroid-binding globulin. Corticosteroids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor inhibiting pro-inflammatory signals, while promoting anti-inflammatory signals. Corticosteroids have a wide therapeutic window as patients may require doses that are multiples of what the body naturally produces. Patients who require long-term treatment with a corticosteroid should be counselled regarding the risk of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression and increased susceptibility to infections. As a member of the corticosteroid family, betamethasone is indicated for the treatment of several inflammatory conditions.

Isoflavone is a soy phytoestrogen and a biologically active component of several agriculturally important legumes such as soy, peanut, green peas, chick peas and alfalfa. Soybean is an exceptionally rich source of dietary isoflavones, where the average isoflavone content is 1-2 mg/gram. The main soy isoflavones are mostly present in glycosylated forms and include , , and glycitein, which accounts for approximately 50%, 40%, and 10%, respectively, of the total soybean isoflavone content. The clinical benefits of soy proteins have been studied and demonstrated for many years, with some evidence of soy products associated with a reduced incidences of coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis, type II diabetes mellitus, and breast and prostate cancer. While existing data are consistent or inadequate in supporting most of the suggested health benefits of consuming soy proteins and isoflavones , the trials investigating isoflavone as a potential treatment for atrophy, menopause, and postmenopausal symptoms are ongoing. Isoflavone is found as one of constituents in oral over-the-counter dietary supplements indicated for improved bone mass density and body fat regulation. Isoflavones are selective estrogen receptor modulators that exert estrogenic-like effects under certain experimental conditions , as they are structurally similar to mammalian 17β-estradiol. They may bind to both α and β isoforms of estrogen receptor (ER), but with binding affinities to ERβ approximately 20 times higher than that to ERα. The role of isoflavones on estrogen-dependent cancer has been studied, since they may mediate antiestrogenic actions by blocking the binding of endogenous estrogens and their receptor signalling. In cell culture, inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells, probably by arresting the cell cycle progression at the G2–M transition. In addition, genistein was shown to induce apoptosis, modify eicosanoid metabolism, and inhibit angiogenesis. There is an evidence that soy isoflavones may act on androgen receptors to inhibit tyrosine kinase activity, thereby blocking the growth and proliferation of cancer cells.  No pharmacokinetic data available.  Isolated soy protein with isoflavones was shown to decrease LDL cholesterol levels in randomized trials assessed by the American Heart Association. In a study of postmenopausal women, daily dietary intake of 101 mg of aglycone isoflavones (indicating and ) was associated with lowered LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B levels by 8% and reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 6.8% in hypertensive women. In a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of menopausal women, soy isoflavones attenuated bone loss of the spine and decreased the levels of deoxypyridinoline, a bone resorption marker, while increasing serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, a bone formation marker. The findings from studies investigating the effects of soy consumption on menopausal symptoms, breast cancer, and prostate cancer remain somewhat controversial and inconclusive. Consumption of soy isoflavones may decrease the markers of cancer development and progression in prostate cells, including prostate-specific antigen (PSA), testosterone, and androgen receptor in patients with prostate cancer but not in normal subjects. Although epidemiologic data in Asian women demonstrate that high soy food intake is associated with protection against breast cancer, soy foods have little effect on intermediary markers of breast cancer risk and postmenopausal soy intake may not reduce the risk of developing breast cancer. However, preliminary studies show that soy food intake reduces tumor recurrence in breast cancer patients. Soy isoflavones reported to interfere with thyroid peroxidase, which are involved in the production of thyroid hormones. Indicated for over-the-counter use as a dietary supplement for increasing bone density and regulating blood fat. \"\n",

Due to its high hydrophilicity and poor absorption profile, prodrug ,, and other conjugated compounds of fenofibric acid, such as choline fenofibrate, have been developed for improved solubility, gastrointestinal absorption, and bioavailability, and more convenient administration. Having performed clinical studies with in vivo transgenic mice and in vitro human hepatocyte cultures, it is believed that the principal mechanism of action of fenofibric acid is demonstrated through its capability to activate peroxisome proliferator receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha). Fenofibric acid demonstrates serum protein binding of approximately 99% in ordinary and hyperlipidemic subjects. Various clinical studies have shown that elevated levels of total cholesterol, low-desnsity-lipoprotein (LDL-C), and apolipoprotein B (apo B) - an LDL membrane complex - are associated with human atherosclerosis. Concurrently, decreased levels of high-density-lioprotein (HDL-C) and its transport complex, apolipoproteins apo AI and apo AII, are associated with the development of atherosclerosis.

Creatine is excreted as creatinine in the urine. In the muscles, a fraction of the total creatine binds to phosphate - forming creatine phosphate. The reaction is catalysed by creatine kinase, and the result is phosphocreatine (PCr). Phosphocreatine binds with adenosine diphosphate to convert it back to ATP (adenosine triphosphate), an important cellular energy source for short term ATP needs prior to oxidative phosphorylation.  Creatine is a essential, non-proteinaceous amino acid derivative found in all animals. It is synthesized in the kidney, liver, and pancreas from L-arginine, glycine and L-methionine. Following its biosynthesis, creatine is transported to the skeletal muscle, heart, brain and other tissues. Most of the creatine is metabolized in these tissues to phosphocreatine (creatine phosphate). Phosphocreatine is a major energy storage form in the body. Supplemental creatine may have an energy-generating action during anaerobic exercise and may also have neuroprotective and cardioprotective actions. For nutritional supplementation, also for treating dietary shortage or imbalance.\"\n",

      "Terazosin_(16303),\"Terazosin belongs to drug node. Terazosin is a quinazoline derivative alpha-1-selective adrenergic blocking agent indicated for benign prostatic hyperplasia and hypertension. Terazosin blocks adrenaline's action on alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, causing relaxation of smooth muscle in blood vessels and the prostate. Terazosin is selective for alpha-1-adrenoceptors but not their individual subtypes. Inhibition of these alpha-1-adrenoceptors results in relaxation of smooth muscle in blood vessels and the prostate, lowering blood pressure and improving urinary flow. Smooth muscle cells accounts for roughly 40% of the volume of the prostate and so their relaxation reduces pressure on the urethra. 90-94%.

      "Omadacycline_(14465),\"Omadacycline belongs to drug node. Omadacycline has been used in trials studying the treatment of Bacterial Pneumonia, Bacterial Infections, Community-Acquired Infections, and Skin Structures and Soft Tissue Infections. Omadacycline represents a significant advance over the well-known tetracycline family, and has been shown to be highly effective in animal models at treating increasingly problematic, clinically prevalent infections caused by gram-positive bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and by gram-negative, atypical and anaerobic bacteria, including those resistant to currently available classes of antibiotics and known to cause diseases such as pneumonias, urinary tract infections, skin diseases and blood-borne infections in both the hospital and community settings. Omadacycline binds to the primary tetracycline binding site on the bacterial 30s ribosomal subunit with high specificity. There it acts to block protein synthesis, disrupting many facets of cellular function and resulting in either cell death or stasis. Omadacycline exhibits non-linear protein binding and remains 20% bound independent of concentration. Omadacycline can be either bacteriostatic or bacteriocidal depending on the organism involved. It disrupts bacterial protein synthesis without affecting DNA, RNA, or peptidoglycan synthesis. Omadacycline represents an improvement over existing tetracycline agents as it has not been found to be subject to tetracycline resistance mediated by tetracycline efflux pumps encoded by the tet(K), tet(L), and tet(B) or to ribosomal protection proteins encoded by tet(O) and tet(M). Omadacycline is susceptible to RNA mutations which confer resistance to tetracyclines. Omadacycline is indicated for the treatment of community acquired bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections caused by omadacycline-susceptible organisms in adults.\"\n",
      "Favipiravir_(14466),\"Favipiravir belongs to drug node. Discovered by Toyama Chemical Co., Ltd. in Japan, favipiravir is a modified pyrazine analog that was initially approved for therapeutic use in resistant cases of influenza. The antiviral targets RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) enzymes, which are necessary for the transcription and replication of viral genomes. The mechanism of action of favipiravir is novel compared to existing influenza antivirals that primarily prevent entry and exit of the virus from cells. The active favipiravir-RTP selectively inhibits RNA polymerase and prevents replication of the viral genome. There are several hypotheses as to how favipiravir-RTP interacts with RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Some studies have shown that when favipiravir-RTP is incorporated into a nascent RNA strand, it prevents RNA strand elongation and viral proliferation. Studies have also found that the presence of purine analogs can reduce favipiravir’s antiviral activity, suggesting competition between favipiravir-RTP and purine nucleosides for RdRp binding. Favipiravir is 54% plasma protein-bound. Of this fraction, 65% is bound to serum albumin and 6.5% is bound to ɑ1-acid glycoprotein. Favipiravir functions as a prodrug and undergoes ribosylation and phosphorylation intracellularly to become the active favipiravir-RTP. Favipiravir-RTP binds to and inhibits RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which ultimately prevents viral transcription and replication. In 2014, favipiravir was approved in Japan to treat cases of influenza that were unresponsive to conventional treatment. Given its efficacy at targetting several strains of influenza, it has been investigated in other countries to treat novel viruses including Ebola and most recently, COVID-19.\"\n",
      "Copanlisib_(14467),\"Copanlisib belongs to drug node. Copanlisib is a selective pan-Class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K/Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase/phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase) inhibitor that was first developed by Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The drug targets the enzyme that plays a role in regulating cell growth and survival. Copanlisib was granted accelerated approval on September 14, 2017 under the market name Aliqopa for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma and a treatment history of at least two prior systemic therapies. Follicular lymphoma is a slow-growing type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is caused by unregulated proliferation and growth of lymphocytes. The active ingredient in Aliquopa intravenous therapy is copanlisib dihydrochloride. Follicular lymphoma is a B-cell lymphoma that is one of the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). It involves unregulated growth and proliferation of lymphocytes that eventually may travel to other organs including the lymph nodes, spleen, and the bone marrow, to form tumors. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-mediated pathway is involved in promoting cell survival proliferation and differentiation however abberant activation of this pathway may lead to tumorigenesis. Copanlisib mediates an inhibitory action on p110α and p110δ isoforms of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) expressed in maligt B cells. It induces tumor cell death via apoptosis and inhibits the proliferation of primary maligt B cell lines. Copanlisib inhibits several key cell-signaling pathways, including B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, CXCR12 mediated chemotaxis of maligt B cells, and NFκB signaling in lymphoma cell lines.  The *in vitro* human plasma protein binding of copanlisib is 84.2%, with albumin being the main binding protein.  Copanlisib has demonstrated potent anti-tumor and pro-apoptotic activity in various tumor cell lines and xenograft models. In clinical trials, 59 percent of patients receiving copanlisib achieved complete or partial shrinkage of their tumors after a median of 12.2 months. Higher systemic levels of copanlisib is associated with elevated plasma glucose levels.  Indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma (FL) who have received at least two prior systemic therapies.\"\n",
      "Lurbinectedin_(14468),\"Lurbinectedin belongs to drug node. Lurbinectedin is a DNA alkylating agent that has been investigated in the treatment of a variety of cancers, including mesothelioma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), breast cancer, and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). It is a derivative of the marine-derived agent ecteinascidin (), an anticancer agent found in extracts of the tunicate _Ecteinascidia turbinata_, with the primary difference being the substitution of the tetrahydroisoquinoline with a tetrahydro β‐carboline that results in increased antitumour activity of lurbinectedin as compared to its predecessor. Lurbinectedin is a DNA alkylating agent. It covalently binds to guanine residues in the DNA minor groove, forming adducts that bend the DNA helix towards the major groove. This process triggers a cascade of events that affect the activity of transcription factors and impairs DNA repair pathways, ultimately leading to double-strand DNA breaks and eventual cell death. Additional mechanism(s) of action include inhibition of RNA-polymerase-II activity, inactivation of Ewing Sarcoma Oncoprotein (EWS-FL11) via nuclear redistribution, and the inhibition of human monocyte activity and macrophage infiltration into tumor tissue. Lurbinectedin is highly protein-bound in plasma (~99%) to both serum albumin and α-1-acid glycoprotein. Lurbinectedin exerts its chemotherapeutic activity by covalently binding to DNA, resulting in double-strand DNA breaks and subsequent cell death. Lurbinectedin has been associated with myelosuppression, and patients receiving therapy with this agent should be closely monitored for evidence of cytopenias. Prior to beginning therapy, ensure baseline neutrophil counts are >1,500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> and platelet counts are >100,000/mm<sup>3</sup>. The supplementary use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) should be considered if the neutrophil count falls below 500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. Lurbinectedin has also been associated with hepatotoxicity. Monitor liver function tests at baseline and regular intervals throughout therapy, and consider holding, reducing, or permanently discontinuing therapy based on the severity of observed hepatotoxicity. Lurbinectedin is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.\"\n",
      "Grapiprant_(14469),\"Grapiprant belongs to drug node. Grapiprant, also known as AT-001 and CJ-023, is a drug from the piprant class. These molecules were derived from acylsulfonamide and are characterized to be a novel series of para-N-acylaminomethylbenzoic acid known to be prostaglandin receptor antagonists. This type of molecules is currently in development for veterinary patients. This class of drugs was defined in 2013 by the World Health Organization.  Grapiprant is an EP4 prostaglandin receptor antagonist and thus the activity of this drug is thought to be completely related to the selective blockade of this receptor. It binds to human and other mammals EP4 prostaglandin receptor with high affinity without interfering with other prostaglandin pathways which are important for a variety of physiological functions. The binding of grapiprant blocks PGE2 binding and hence its biological effect related to the signaling pain and inflammation cascade. The serum protein binding of grapiprant was of about 95%. The main protein that binds to grapiprant is albumin. Preclinical studies have shown that grapiprant is very effective to reduce acute and chronic pain and inflammation. The effect of grapiprant seems to be dose-dependent and it is comparable to the effect of rofecoxib and piroxicam. The effects of grapiprant have been investigated in the area of analgesia and anti-inflammation due to the effects that have been reported about this molecule.\"\n",
      "Darolutamide_(14470),\"Darolutamide belongs to drug node. Darolutamide is a nonsteroidal androgen receptor antagonist for the treatment of castrate-resistant, non-metastatic prostate cancer (nmCRPC). This condition occurs in the majority of patients with advanced prostate cancer who have been treated with androgen receptor antagonists. Though prior treatment for prostate cancer has been successful for these patients, the cancer eventually progresses to become resistant to existing therapies. This warrants further treatment. The actions of androgens on androgen receptors (AR) potentiate the growth and survival of prostate cancer cells. Darolutamide competitively inhibits androgens from binding to their receptors, inhibiting AR nuclear translocation, as well as AR-mediated transcription. The end result of these processes is a decrease in prostate cancer cell proliferation and tumor size. Its main metabolite, keto-darolutamide, shows similar pharmacological activity to the parent drug, darolutamide. Darolutamide has been found to bind more tightly to the AR receptor than and , which are other androgen receptor antagonists. The plasma protein binding for darolutamide is 92% and 99.8% for keto-darolutamide, the active metabolite. They are mainly bound to albumin. Darolutamide, through its downstream effects on cancer cell growth, treats castrate-resistant prostate cancer. It inhibits cancer cell growth and markedly lowers prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels through potent androgen receptor antagonism. This drug is indicated for the treatment of patients diagnosed with non-metastatic and castrate-resistant prostate cancer.\"\n",
      "Testosterone cypionate_(14476),\"Testosterone cypionate belongs to drug node. Testosterone cypionate is a synthetic derivative of testosterone in the form of an oil-soluble 17 (beta)-cyclopentylpropionate ester. Its benefit compared to other testosterone derivatives is the slow rate of release after injection and longer half-life. The characteristics of testosterone cypionate and testosterone ethate are very similar, therefore both of them tend to be interchangeable. It was developed by the company Pharmacia and Upjohn and FDA approved on July 25, 1979. The effects of testosterone in humans and other vertebrates occur by way of two main mechanisms: by activation of the androgen receptor (directly or as DHT), and by conversion to estradiol and activation of certain estrogen receptors. Free testosterone (T) is transported into the cytoplasm of target tissue cells, where it can bind to the androgen receptor, or can be reduced to 5&alpha;-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme 5&alpha;-reductase. DHT binds to the same androgen receptor even more strongly than T, so that its androgenic potency is about 2.5 times that of T. The T-receptor or DHT-receptor complex undergoes a structural change that allows it to move into the cell nucleus and bind directly to specific nucleotide sequences of the chromosomal DNA. The areas of binding are called hormone response elements (HREs), and influence transcriptional activity of certain genes, producing the androgen effects. Once absorbed, testosterone cypionate enters the bloodstream to be processed. Once modified, 40% of the resultant testosterone will bind to plasma globulin and 2% remains unbound or bound to albumin and other proteins. Testosterone cypionate presents the same properties than its analog testosterone with the advantage that this molecule has a longer release rate and half-life. Administration of ester derivatives of testosterone as testosterone cypionate generates an increase in serum testosterone to levels reaching 400% from the baseline within 24 hours of administration. These androgen levels remain elevated for 3-5 days after initial administration. The continuous variation in plasma testosterone after intramuscular administration of testosterone cypionate results in fluctuations in mood and libido as well as some local inflammation. Testosterone cypionate is used in males that present conditions derived from a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone. These conditions are 1) primary hypogonadism, defined as the testicular failure due to cryptorchidism, bilateral torsion, orchitis, vanishing testis syndrome or orchidectomy; and 2) hypogonadotropic hypogonadism characterized by idiopathic gonadotropin, LHRH deficiency or pituitary-hypothalamic injury from tumors, trauma or radiation.\"\n",
      "Testosterone enanthate_(14477),\"Testosterone enanthate belongs to drug node. Testosterone ethate is an esterified variant of testosterone that comes as an injectable compound with a slow release rate. It is the first injectable ester preparation of testosterone. This slow release is achieved by the presence of the ethate ester functional group attached to the testosterone molecule. This testosterone derivative was first approved on December 24, 1953. The effects of testosterone in humans and other vertebrates occur by way of two main mechanisms: by activation of the androgen receptor (directly or as DHT), and by conversion to estradiol and activation of certain estrogen receptors. Free testosterone (T) is transported into the cytoplasm of target tissue cells, where it can bind to the androgen receptor, or can be reduced to 5&alpha;-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme 5&alpha;-reductase.

The T-receptor or DHT-receptor complex undergoes a structural change that allows it to move into the cell nucleus and bind directly to specific nucleotide sequences of the chromosomal DNA. The areas of binding are called hormone response elements (HREs), and influence transcriptional activity of certain genes, producing androgen effects. Circulating testosterone is primarily bound in serum to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin. Approximately 40% of testosterone in plasma is bound to SHBG, 2% remains unbound (free), and the rest is loosely bound to albumin and other proteins. Testosterone ethate presents the same properties as its analog testosterone with the advantage that this molecule has a longer release rate and half-life. Administration of ester derivatives of testosterone as testosterone ethate generates an increase in serum testosterone to levels reaching 400% from the baseline within 24 hours of administration. These androgen levels remain elevated for 3-5 days after initial administration. Continuous administration of testosterone ethate shows a significant suppression of dihydrotestosterone, serum PSA, HDL and FSH, as well as a slight increase in serum estradiol. The levels of dihydrotestosterone and FSH can remain suppressed even 14 days after treatment termination. There are no changes in mood and sexual activity by the presence of testosterone ethate. Testosterone ethate in males is indicated as a replacement therapy in conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone. Some of the treated conditions are 1) primary hypogonadism, defined as testicular failure due to cryptorchidism, bilateral torsion, orchitis, vanishing testis syndrome or orchidectomy; 2) hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to an idiopathic gonadotropin or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone deficiency or due to a pituitary-hypothalamic injury from tumors, trauma or radiation, in this case it is important to accompany the treatment with adrenal cortical and thyroid hormone replacement therapy; 3) to stimulate puberty in patients with delayed puberty not secondary to a pathological disorder. If the conditions 1 and 2 occur prior to puberty, the androgen replacement therapy will be needed during adolescent years for the development of secondary sexual characteristics and prolonged androgen treatment might be needed it to maintain sexual characteristics after puberty.\"\n",

It should be noted that testosterone undecanoate is only indicated for treatment of hypogonadal conditions with structural or genetic etiologies and should not be used to manage \\age-related hypogonadism\\\"\". \"\" Testosterone is produced by Leydig cells and exerts it's effects by binding to androgen receptors throughout the body.  Testosterone affects the voice, genitalia, mood, and influences muscle growth and protein expression.  Accordingly, males with low levels of testosterone often experience decreased libido, fatigue, mood changes and dysphoria.  Exogenous sources of testosterone are designed to mimic the effects of endogenous testosterone. Circulating testosterone is highly protein bound with about 40% bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and a large percentage of the remaining hormone loosely bound to albumin and other plasma proteins. Only about 2% of testosterone is unbound.  Testosterone plays a key role in male sexual differentiation and is involved in regulation of hematopoiesis, body composition, and bone metabolism. As a result, testosterone replacement therapy in males with hypogonadism can result in improved sexual function, increased lean body mass, bone density, erythropoiesis, prostate size, and changes in lipid profiles.  Testosterone undecanoate is indicated for replacement therapy in adult males with conditions that are linked with an absence or deficiency in endogenous testosterone production. \"\n",

Paritaprevir is a direct acting antiviral medication used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as paritaprevir. As a newer generation and directly acting HCV antiviral, paritaprevir products have better Sustained Virological Response (SVR) rates, higher barriers to resistance, fewer side effects, and a reduced pill burden compared to older agents such as , , , , and. By combining multiple antiretroviral medications into fixed dose products, the viral lifecycle can be targeted at multiple stages while simultaneously reducing the risk of developing resistant viral strains. Within Canada and the United States, paritaprevir is currently available in three fixed dose products: Viekira Pak (FDA), Technivie (FDA and Health Canada), and Holkira Pak (Health Canada). Paritaprevir is a potent inhibitor of the NS3/4A serine protease of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). Following viral replication of HCV genetic material and translation into a single polypeptide, Nonstructural Protein 3 (NS3) and its activating cofactor Nonstructural Protein 4A (NS4A) are responsible for cleaving it into the following structural and nonstructural proteins required for assembly into mature virus: NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B. By inhibiting viral protease NS3/4A, paritaprevir therefore prevents viral replication and function. 97 to 98.6% bound to human plasma proteins. At concentrations approximately 6 and 1.8 times the therapeutic concentrations of paritaprevir and ombitasvir, the combination did not prolong QTc to any clinically relevant extent. When used within the fixed-dose combination product with , , and as the FDA-approved product Viekira Pak, paritaprevir is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotype 1b without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, and when combined with for the treatment of HCV genotype 1a without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis.\"\n",

Elbasvir is a direct-acting antiviral medication used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients. Treatment options for chronic hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) such as elbasvir. Elbasvir is an inhibitor of NS5A, a protein essential for viral replication and virion assembly. The barrier to the development of resistance to NS5A inhibitors is lower than that of NS5B inhibitors, another class of DAAs. Substitutions at amino acid positions 28, 30, 31, or 93 are known to confer resistance to elbasvir. Despite this disadvantage elbasvir is still effective against HCV, particularly when paired with. Elbasvir is an inhibitor of the HCV non-structural protein 5A. While the precise role of this protein is unknown, it is essential to viral replication and virion assembly. Potential modes of action of NS5A inhibitors like elbasvir include blocking signaling interactions, redistribution of NS5A from the endoplasmic reticulum to the surface of lipid droplets, and modification of the HCV replication complex. Elbasvir is more than 99.9% bound to plasma proteins. It binds both human serum albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein. Elbasvir is classified as a direct-acting antiviral (DAA) and prevents viral replication in HCV genotypes 1a, 1b, and 4.

      "Asunaprevir_(15043),\"Asunaprevir belongs to drug node. Asunaprevir, also named as BMS-650032, is a potent hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 protease inhibitor. It has been shown to have a very high efficacy in dual-combination regimens with daclatasvir in patients chronically infected with HCV genotype 1b. It was developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Canada and approved by Health Canada on April 22, 2016. The commercialization of asunaprevir was canceled one year later on October 16, 2017. Asunaprevir is a highly active HCV NS3 protease inhibitor. The genome of HCV has a positive polarity which allows it to be translated into a protein in the host cell without further transformation steps. However, the resultant protein needs to be divided by the enzyme NS3 protease into single proteins in order to be able to exert its enzymatic activity or structural role. Therefore, due to NS3 vital importance for viral replication, the inhibiting action of asunaprevir causes a robust antiviral activity. Protein binding of asunaprevir is very high and it can reach more than 99% of the administered dose independently of the dose. In vitro studies with human Caco-2 cells indicated that asunaprevir is a substrate of P-gp, OATP1B1 and OATP2B1. Studies in vitro demonstrated a significant antiviral activity in HCV replicon cell systems with an EC50 of 4nm and 1nm against the HCV genotype 1a and 1b respectively. These studies showed a limited activity against the genotypes 2 and 3. This property makes asunaprevir a highly selective anti-HCV agent that is not effective against HCV closely related virus. Asunaprevir produce robust declines in HCV RNA levels in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection.In clinical studies, it has been shown that asunaprevir is well-tolerated and the mean maximum HCV RNA level reduction from baseline was of approximately 2.87 log10 IU/ml. Asunaprevir is indicated in combination with other agents for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in adult patients with hepatitis C virus genotypes 1 or 4 and compensated liver cirrhosis. \"\n",
      "Isavuconazole_(15044),\"Isavuconazole belongs to drug node. Isavuconazole is an triazole antifungal with broad spectrum of activity and good safety profile. It is approved by the FDA and EMA for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis and mucormycosis. It works by inhibiting fungal cell membrane synthesis. Invasive fungal infections pose significant clinical challenges for patients, especially those who are immunocompromised. In vitro, most of the _Candida_ species, most _Aspergillus_ species, Mucorales, _Cryptococcus_ spp., _Fusarium_ species, dermatophytes and dimorphic fungi displayed susceptibility to isavuconzaole. Resistance to isavuconazole has been associated with the mutation in the target gene CYP51. Cross-resistance between isavuconazole and other azoles was also proposed although the clinical relevance is unclear.  Isavuconazole displays fungicidal actions by disrupting the biosynthesis of ergosterol, which is a key component of fungal cell membrane. It inhibits cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase that mediates the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol. The side arm of of the active isavuconazole molecule allows for greater affinity for the binding pocket in the fungal CYP51 protein by orienting the triazole ring of the molecule to engage with the heme moiety at the bottom of the binding pocket. This explains the wide antifungal spectrum of isavuconazole and possible cross-resistance to other triazoles. As a result of lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase inhibition, toxic methylated sterol precursors such as 14-α-methylated lanosterol, 4,14-dimethylzymosterol, and 24-methylenedihydrolanosterol alter the function of fungal membrane and accumulate within the fungal cytoplasm. Depletion of ergosterol within the fungal cell membrane leads to decreased structural integrity and function of the cell membrane, inhibited fungal cell growth and replication , and ultimately cell death. Mammalian cell demethylation is less sensitive to isavuconazole inhibition. Isavuconazole is highly protein bound (greater than 99%), predomitly to albumin. Isavucoanzole exhibits antifungal activity against most strains of _Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger_, and Mucorales such as _Rhizopus oryzae_ and Mucormycetes species _in vivo_ and _in vitro_. In a cardiac electrophysiology study involving healthy subjects, isavuconazole induced dose-related shortening of the QTc interval but the additive effect of isavuconazole with other QTc-prolonging drug is unknown.  - Indicated for patients 18 years of age and older for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis.\"\n",
      "Tezacaftor_(15045),\"Tezacaftor belongs to drug node. Tezacaftor is a drug of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) potentiator class. It was developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals and FDA approved in combination with to manage cystic fibrosis. This drug was approved by the FDA on February 12, 2018. The transport of charged ions across cell membranes is normally achieved through the actions of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) protein. This protein acts as a channel and allows for the passage of chloride and sodium. This process affects the movement of water in and out of the tissues and impacts the production of mucus that lubricates and protects certain organs and body tissues, including the lungs. In the _F508del_ mutation of the CFTR gene, one amino acid is deleted at the position 508, therefore, the CFTR channel function is compromised, resulting in thickened mucus secretions. CFTR correctors such as tezacaftor aim to repair F508del cellular misprocessing. This is done by modulating the position of the CFTR protein on the cell surface to the correct position, allowing for adequate ion channel formation and increased in water and salt movement through the cell membrane. The concomitant use of ivacaftor is intended to maintain an open channel, increasing the transport of chloride, reducing thick mucus production. Tezacaftor is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, mainly albumin. Clinical studies have shown a significant decrease in sweat chloride and an increase in the forced expiratory volume (FEV), a measure of lung function, following Tevacaftor/Ivacaftor therapy. Phase 3 clinical studies have shown that a significant increase in forced expiratory volume was attained at 4 and 8 weeks after initiating this drug. The above effects lead to improvement of the respiratory symptoms of cystic fibrosis. Tezacaftor does not induce clinically significant QT prolongation. When given with ivacaftor, tezacaftor can lead to liver transaminase elevations. Testing of transaminases (ALT and AST) levels should occur before starting this combination every 3 months during the first year of treatment, and every year afterwards. Patients with a history of transaminase elevations should be monitored more frequently. Tezacaftor is combined with ivacaftor in one product for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 12 years or older with two copies of the _F508del_ gene mutation or at least one mutation in the CFTR gene that is responsive to this drug.\"\n",
      "Lemborexant_(15052),\"Lemborexant belongs to drug node. Lemborexant is a novel dual orexin receptor antagonist used in the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintece. Recent research in the field of sleep disorders has revealed that insomnia is likely driven not by the inability of the brain to \\switch on\\\"\" sleep-related circuits, but rather an inability to \\\"\"switch-off\\\"\" wake-promoting circuits. Whereas historically popular pharmacologic treatments for insomnia (e.g. , , benzodiazepines) focus on enhancing sleep drive via modulation of GABA and melatonin receptors, lemborexant and other orexin antagonists (e.g. ) act to counteract inappropriate wakefulness. This novel mechanism of action offers potential advantages over classic hypnotic agents, including a more favorable adverse effect profile and potentially greater efficacy, and may signal the beginning of a new wave of treatment options for patients suffering from insomnia.\"\" The orexin neuropeptide signaling system is involved in many physiologic functions, including sleep/wake control. Orexin-A and orexin-B activate post-synaptic G-protein coupled orexin-1 receptors (OX1R) and orexin-2 receptors (OX2R), which are found on neurons in the hypothalamus that project to numerous wake-controlling nuclei. Each receptor carries slightly different activity - activation of OX1R appears to suppress the onset of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, whereas activation of OX2R appears to suppress non-REM sleep. Lemborexant is approximately 94% protein-bound _in vitro_, though the specific proteins to which it binds in plasma have not been elucidated. Lemborexant promotes sleep by antagonizing the actions of wake-promoting chemicals in the brain. Episodes of complex sleep behaviors (e.g. eating food, having sex, making phone calls) have been reported in patients using lemborexant - these events may occur in hypnotic-naive and hyponotic-experienced patients, and patients are unlikely to remember these events. Patients exhibiting complex sleep behaviors should discontinue lemborexant immediately. Lemborexant may carry some risk of abuse, and should be used with caution in patients with a history of alcohol or drug addiction. Its controlled substance schedule is currently under review by the Drug Enforcement Administration. Lemborexant is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintece.\"\n",
      "Letermovir_(15053),\"Letermovir belongs to drug node. Letermovir recieved approval from the FDA on November 8th, 2017 for use in prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients. It represents the first entry into a new class of CMV anti-infectives, DNA terminase complex inhibitors. Letermovir has recieved both priority and orphan drug status from the FDA. It is currently marketed under the brand name Prevymis. CMV relies on a DNA terminase complex consisting of multiple subunits (pUL51, pUL56, and pUL89) for processing of viral DNA. Viral DNA is produced in a single repeating strand which is then cut by the DNA terminase complex into individual viral genomes which can then be packaged into mature viral particles. Letemovir inhibits the activity of this complex to prevent production of mature viral genomes and the production of viable viral particles. The exact nature of Letemovir's binding to this complex is not currently known. Initially, the observation of resistance-causing mutations in pUL56 suggested this subunit was the location of Letemovir binding. However, resistance mutations have now been observed in pUL51, pUL56, and pUL89. It is possible that changes in amino acid sequence in one subunit could result in conformational changes to interacting subunits affecting Letemovir binding or that Letemovir interacts with multiple subunits of the complex but evidence towards either of these distinctions has not yet been seen. pUL89 is known to contain the endonuclease activity of the complex but because all members of the complex are necessary for targeting as well as protection from proteosomal degradation, it is difficult to discern if Letemovir inhibits pUL89's activity directly. Letermovir has been observed to be 99% bound to plasma proteins at concentrations of 0.2-50 mg/L in vitro. Letermovir inhibits the activity of the DNA terminase complex of CMV thereby preventing the cutting of viral DNA into mature length genomes for packaging into viral particles. Letemovir inhibits the DNA terminase complex with an EC50 of 2.1nM.

      "Rucaparib_(15057),\"Rucaparib belongs to drug node. Rucaparib is a potent mammalian poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) 1, 2 and 3 inhibitor with anticancer properties. PPAR is an enzyme that plays an essential role in DNA repair by activating response pathways and facilitating repair , and defects in these repair mechanisms have been demonstrated in various maligcies, including cancer. Regulation of repair pathways is critical in promoting necessary cell death. BRCA genes are tumor suppressor genes mediate several cellular process including DNA replication, transcription regulation, cell cycle checkpoints, apoptosis, chromatin structuring and homologous recombination (HR). Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), along with PPAR inhibition, is a vulnerability that enhances the cell death pathway when the single mutations alone would permit viability. Ovarian cancer commonly possesses defects in DNA repair pathways such as HRD due to BRCA mutations or otherwise.  Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes play a role in DNA repair. PPAR-1 is responsible in repairing single stranded breaks (SSBs) in base excision repair (BER). PARP1 also functions in nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) regulation, chromatin remodeling and homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair pathways. When PARP is inhibited, single-strand breaks become double-strand breaks, which are typically repaired via homologous recombination. Pre-existing homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) may occur through mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, which confers persistant cell repair and growth in cancer cells.  In vitro, the protein binding of rucaparib was 70% in human plasma at therapeutic concentrations. Rucaparib preferentially distributed to red blood cells with a blood-to-plasma concentration ratio of 1.83.  Rucaparib has been shown to decrease tumor growth in mouse xenograft models of human cancer with or without deficiencies in BRCA. Indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic) associated advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies.

      "Fluvoxamine_(15073),\"Fluvoxamine belongs to drug node. Fluvoxamine is an antidepressant which functions pharmacologically as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Though it is in the same class as other SSRI drugs, it is most often used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder. The exact mechanism of action of fluvoxamine has not been fully determined, but appears to be linked to its inhibition of CNS neuronal uptake of serotonin. Fluvoxamine blocks the reuptake of serotonin at the serotonin reuptake pump of the neuronal membrane, enhancing the actions of serotonin on 5HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptors. Studies have also demonstrated that fluvoxamine has virtually no affinity for α<sub>1</sub>- or α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic, β-adrenergic, muscarinic, dopamine D<sub>2</sub>, histamine H<sub>1</sub>, GABA-benzodiazepine, opiate, 5-HT<sub>1</sub>, or 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptors, despite having an affinity for binding to σ1 receptors. ~77-80% (plasma protein). Fluvoxamine, an aralkylketone-derivative agent , is one of a class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) that differs structurally from other SSRIs. It is used to treat the depression associated with mood disorders. It is also used on occassion in the treatment of body dysmorphic disorder and anxiety. The antidepressant, antiobsessive-compulsive, and antibulimic actions of Fluvoxamine are presumed to be linked to its inhibition of CNS neuronal uptake of serotonin. <i>In vitro</i> studies show that Fluvoxamine is a potent and selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake and has only very weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake. Moreover, apart from binding to σ1 receptors , fluvoxamine has no significant affinity for adrenergic (alpha1, alpha2, beta), cholinergic, GABA, dopaminergic, histaminergic, serotonergic (5HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5HT<sub>1B</sub>, 5HT<sub>2</sub>), or benzodiazepine receptors; antagonism of such receptors has been hypothesized to be associated with various anticholinergic, sedative, and cardiovascular effects for other psychotropic drugs. Furthermore, some studies have demonstrated that the chronic administration of Fluvoxamine was found to downregulate brain norepinephrine receptors (as has been observed with other drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder), while others suggest the opposite. Indicated predomitly for the management of depression and for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Has also been used in the management of bulimia nervosa.\"\n",
      "Amphetamine_(15074),\"Amphetamine belongs to drug node. Amphetamine, a compound discovered over 100 years ago, is one of the more restricted controlled drugs. It was previously used for a large variety of conditions and this changed until this point where its use is highly restricted. Amphetamine, with the chemical formula alpha-methylphenethylamine, was discovered in 1910 and first synthesized by 1927. After being proven to reduce drug-induced anesthesia and produce arousal and insomnia, amphetamine racemic mix was registered by Smith, Kline and French in 1935. Amphetamine structure presents one chiral center and it exists in the form of dextro- and levo-isomers. The first product of Smith, Kline and French was approved by the FDA on 1976. It is important to consider that amphetamine has a very similar structure to the catecholamine neurotransmitters mainly on the presence of a long planar conformation, the presence of an aromatic ring and nitrogen in the aryl side chain. Amphetamine, as well as other catecholamines, is taken into presynaptic nerve terminals by the association with two sodium ions and one chloride ion. The complex of the amphetamine with the ions is actively transported by monoamine reuptake transporters. As amphetamine acts competitively with the endogenous monoamines, the greater the number of amphetamines the more internalized amphetamine will be found. The reported protein binding of amphetamine is relatively low and register to be of 20%. From its mechanism of action, it has been demonstrated that amphetamine augments the concentration of noradrenaline in the prefrontal cortex and dopamine in the striatum on a dose and time-dependent manner. The indistinct release of neurotransmitters which include adrenaline is known to produce cardiovascular side effects.  Amphetamine is indicated for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) as well as for the treatment of central nervous system disorders such as narcolepsy. \"\n",
      "Bortezomib_(15077),\"Bortezomib belongs to drug node. Bortezomib is a dipeptide boronic acid derivative and proteasome inhibitor used to treat multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. It is a reversible inhibitor of the 26S proteasome, which is a protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Inhibition of 26S proteasome leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of cancer cells. While inhibition of the 26S proteasome is the main mechanism of action, multiple mechanisms may involved in the therapeutic action of bortezomib. Bortezomib is a reversible inhibitor of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 26S proteasome in mammalian cells. The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The active site of the proteasome has chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and postglutamyl peptide hydrolysis activity. The 26S proteasome degrades various proteins critical to cancer cell survival, such as cyclins, tumor suppressors, BCL-2, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. Inhibition of these degradations sensitizes cells to apoptosis. Bortezomib is a potent inhibitor of 26S proteasome, which sensitizes activity in dividing multiple myeloma and leukemic cells, thus inducing apoptosis. In addition, bortezomib appears to increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to traditional anticancer agents (e.g., gemcitabine, cisplatin, paclitaxel, irinotecan, and radiation). Over the concentration range of 100 to 1000 ng/mL, bortezomib is about 83% bound to human plasma proteins. Bortezomib works to target the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, an essential molecular pathway that promotes protein degradation and maintains the homeostatic intracellular concentrations of proteins. However, there is strong evidence in the literature that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is often dysregulated, leading to aberrant pathway signalling. In one study, patient-derived chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells contained 3-fold higher levels of chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity than normal lymphocytes, indicating that dysregulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is implicated in maligt cell transformation. By reversibly inhibiting an enzyme involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, bortezomib prevents the proteasome-mediated proteolysis. Bortezomib exerts a cytotoxic effect on various cancer cell types _in vitro_. In non-clinical tumour models, including multiple myeloma, bortezomib caused a delay in tumour growth. Bortezomib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma or mantle cell lymphoma.\"\n",

Its chemical structure is unrelated to that of other SSRIs or of tricyclic, tetracyclic, or other prescribed antidepressants. Citalopram is also known as _Celexa_, and available in tablet and solution forms. This drug was initially approved by the FDA in 1998.  Citalopram, dimethylcitalopram, and didemethylcitalopram are 80% bound to plasma proteins. Citalopram belongs to a class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It has been found to relieve or manage symptoms of depression, anxiety, eating disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder among other mood disorders. The antidepressant, anti-anxiety, and other actions of citalopram are linked to its inhibition of CNS central uptake of serotonin.

      "Reboxetine_(15083),\"Reboxetine belongs to drug node. Reboxetine is an antidepressant drug used in the treatment of clinical depression, panic disorder and ADD/ADHD. Its mesylate (i.e. methanesulfonate) salt is sold under tradenames including Edronax, Norebox, Prolift, Solvex, Davedax or Vestra. Reboxetine has two chiral centers, but it only exists as two etiomers, (R,R)-(-)- and (S,S)-(+)-reboxetine. Reboxetine is a selective inhibitor of noradrenaline reuptake. It inhibits noradrenaline reuptake <i>in vitro</i> to a similar extent to the tricyclic antidepressant desmethylimipramine. Reboxetine does not affect dopamine or serotonin reuptake and it has low <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> affinity for adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors. 98% Reboxetine is a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (NaRI), the first drug of new antidepressant class.

      "Clotrimazole_(15084),\"Clotrimazole belongs to drug node. This drug is a broad spectrum antimycotic or antifungal agent. Clotrimazole's antimycotic properties were discovered in the late 1960s. Clotrimazole falls under the _imidazole_ category of _azole_ antifungals, possessing broad-spectrum antimycotic activity. It is available in various preparations, including creams, pessaries, and troche formulations (slowly dissolving tablets). As well as its antifungal activity, clotrimazole has become a drug of interest in treating several other diseases such as sickle cell disease, malaria and some cancers. The minimal side effect profile of this drug and its uncomplicated metabolic profile have led it to gain widespread acceptance for the treatment of mycotic outbreaks such as vaginal yeast infections as well as athlete's foot. Clotrimazole acts primarily by damaging the permeability barrier in the cell membrane of fungi. Clotrimazole causes inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis, an essential constituent of fungal cell membranes. If ergosterol synthesis is either completely or partially inhibited, the cell is no longer able to construct an intact and functional cell membrane ,. Because ergosterol directly promotes the growth of fungal cells in a hormone‐like fashion, rapid onset of the above events leads to dose-dependent inhibition of fungal growth. 98%  Clotrimazole is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent that inhibits the growth of pathogenic yeasts by changing the permeability of cell membranes. The action of clotrimazole is fungistatic at concentrations of drug up to 20 mcg/mL and may be fungicidal _in vitro_ against Candida albicans and other species of the genus Candida at higher concentrations. Unfortunately, resistance to clotrimazole, which was rare in the past, is now common in various patient populations.  **Topical preparations**\"\n",
      "Venlafaxine_(15087),\"Venlafaxine belongs to drug node. Venlafaxine (Effexor) is an antidepressant within the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) class of medications. It exerts its effects primarily by blocking the transporters involved in the reuptake of the neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine, therefore leaving more active neurotransmitter in the synapse. Venlafaxine is officially approved for use in the management of major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. As of 2014, Canadian clinical practice guidelines recommend venlafaxine as a first-line option for treatment of generalized anxiety, social anxiety, panic disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), and consider it a second-line option for management of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Venlafaxine is also used off-label for prophylaxis of migraine headaches , for reduction of vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause , and for management of neuropathic pain (although there is only minimal evidence of efficacy for this condition). The exact mechanism of action of venlafaxine is unknown, but appears to be associated with the potentiation of neurotransmitter activity in the CNS. Venlafaxine and its active metabolite, O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV), inhibit the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine with a potency greater for the 5-HT than for the NE reuptake process. Both venlafaxine and the ODV metabolite have weak inhibitory effects on the reuptake of dopamine but, unlike the tricyclics and similar to SSRIs, they are not active at histaminergic, muscarinic, or alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors. The degree of binding of venlafaxine to human plasma is 27% ± 2% at concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 2215 ng/mL. The degree of ODV binding to human plasma is 30% ± 12% at concentrations ranging from 100 to 500 ng/mL. Protein-binding-induced drug interactions with venlafaxine are not expected. The mechanism of venlafaxine's (and its metabolite, O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV)) antidepressant effect is believed to be due to their potentiation of neurotransmitter activity in the central nervous system through the inhibition of the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine from within the synapse. Venlafaxine has also been shown to weakly inhibit dopamine reuptake. Neither venlafaxine nor ODV bind to muscarinic, histaminergic, or alpha-1 adrenergic receptors; pharmacologic activity at these receptors is hypothesized to be associated with the various anticholinergic, sedative, and cardiovascular effects seen with other psychotropic drugs. Hyponatremia has also been shown to occur as a result of treatment with SNRIs, and is associated with the development of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Venlafaxine also demonstrates a clinically significant and dose-related effect on blood pressure, likely due to its potentiation of norepinephrine. Venlafaxine is indicated in the management of major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (social phobia), and panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. Venlafaxine is also used off-label for prophylaxis of migraine headaches , for reduction of vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause , and for management of neuropathic pain (although there is only minimal evidence of efficacy for this condition). It is also considered a second-line option for management of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). \"\n",

Estriol is a major urinary estrogen. During pregcy, large amount of estriol is produced by the placenta. Isomers with inversion of the hydroxyl group or groups are called epiestriol. Though estriol is used as part of the primarily North American phenomenon of bioidentical hormone replacement therapy, it is not approved for use by the FDA or Health Canada. It is however available in the United States by prescription filled only by compounding pharmacies. It has also been approved and marketed throughout Europe and Asia for approximately 40 years for the treatment of post-menopausal hot flashes. Estriol levels can be measured to give an indication of the general health of the fetus. DHEA-S is produced by the adrenal cortex of the fetus. This is converted to estriol by the placenta. If levels of \\unconjugated estriol\\\"\" are abnormally low in a pregt woman, this may indicate a problem with the development of the child. The drug interacts with a target cell receptor. When the estrogen receptor has bound its ligand it can enter the nucleus of the target cell, and regulate gene transcription which leads to formation of messenger RNA. The mRNA interacts with ribosomes to produce specific proteins that express the effect of estriol upon the target cell.

      "Triclosan_(16459),\"Triclosan belongs to drug node. An aromatic ether that is phenol which is substituted at C-5 by a chloro group and at C-2 by a 2,4-dichlorophenoxy group. It is widely used as a preservative and antimicrobial agent in personal care products such as soaps, skin creams, toothpaste and deodorants as well as in household items such as plastic chopping boards, sports equipment and shoes. Triclosan is a biocidal compound with multiple targets in the cytoplasm and membrane. At lower concentrations, however, triclosan appears bacteriostatic and is seen to target bacteria mainly by inhibiting fatty acid synthesis. Triclosan binds to enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase enzyme (ENR). This complex has increased affinity for NAD+ and forms a ternary complex. This complex is unable to participate in fatty acid synthesis, weakening the cell membrane and causing cell death. Humans do not have an ENR enzyme, and thus are not affected.   Triclosan is used in a variety of common household products, including soaps, mouthwashes, dish detergents, toothpastes, deodorants, and hand sanitizers. It is also used in health care settings in surgical scrubs and personnel hand washes.\"\n",

Pentazocine is a potent analgesic which when administered orally in a 50 mg dose appears equivalent in analgesic effect to 60 mg (1 grain) of codeine. Onset of significant analgesia usually occurs between 15 and 30 minutes after oral administration, and duration of action is usually three hours or longer. Onset and duration of action and the degree of pain relief are related both to dose and the severity of pretreatment pain. Pentazocine weakly antagonizes the analgesic effects of morphine and meperidine; in addition, it produces incomplete reversal of cardiovascular, respiratory, and behavioral depression induced by morphine and meperidine.

Clobazam belongs to the 1,5-benzodiazepine class of drugs and is expected to have a better side-effect profile compared to older 1,4-benzodiazepines. It has been marketed as an anxiolytic since 1975 and an anticonvulsant since 1984. The oral preparation was FDA approved on October 21, 2011. An oral suspension is expected to be available in 2013. Clobazam binds at distinct binding sites associated with the chloride ionopore at the post-synaptic GABA receptor. These GABA receptors are in various locations in the CNS (limbic, reticular formation) and clobazam increases the duration of time for which the chloride ionopore is open. As a result, hyper polarization and stabilization of the membrane occur as the post-synaptic inhibitory effect of GABA is enhanced.  Clobazam is the primary circulating entity in the serum and is highly protein-bound (80-90%).  Similar to other benzodiazepines, clobazam binds to the interface of the α and γ2-subunit of the GABA-A receptor. However, it is considered a partial agonist to GABA-A receptors which sets clobazam apart from 1,4-benzodiazepines which are full agonist. The significance of this difference is that one may experience less sedation with clobazam than with other benzodiazepines. Unlike the endogenous GABA ligand, clobazam binds allosterically to the GABA receptor to increase the frequency of the chloride channel opening and membrane permeability to chloride ions. Pharmacodynamic tolerance has been demonstrated in animal models.  For treatment and management of epilepsy and seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a difficult-to-treat form of childhood epilepsy. \"\n",
      "Clozapine_(15093),\"Clozapine belongs to drug node. A tricyclic dibenzodiazepine, classified as an atypical antipsychotic agent. It binds several types of central nervous system receptors, and displays a unique pharmacological profile. Clozapine is a serotonin antagonist, with strong binding to 5-HT 2A/2C receptor subtype. It also displays strong affinity to several dopaminergic receptors, but shows only weak antagonism at the dopamine D2 receptor, a receptor commonly thought to modulate neuroleptic activity. Agranulocytosis is a major adverse effect associated with administration of this agent. Clozapine's antipsychotic action is likely mediated through a combination of antogistic effects at D2 receptors in the mesolimbic pathway and 5-HT2A receptors in the frontal cortex. D2 antagonism relieves positive symptoms while 5-HT2A antagonism alleviates negative symptoms. 97% (bound to serum proteins) Clozapine is a psychotropic agent belonging to the chemical class of benzisoxazole derivatives and is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia. Clozapine is a selective monoaminergic antagonist with high affinity for the serotonin Type 2 (5HT<sub>2</sub>), dopamine Type 2 (D2), 1 and 2 adrenergic, and H1 histaminergic receptors. Clozapine acts as an antagonist at other receptors, but with lower potency. Antagonism at receptors other than dopamine and 5HT<sub>2</sub> with similar receptor affinities may explain some of the other therapeutic and side effects of clozapine. Clozapine's antagonism of muscarinic M1-5 receptors may explain its anticholinergic effects. Clozapine's antagonism of histamine H1 receptors may explain the somnolence observed with this drug. Clozapine's antagonism of adrenergic a1 receptors may explain the orthostatic hypotension observed with this drug. For use in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia.\"\n",
      "Timolol_(15095),\"Timolol belongs to drug node. Timolol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist given in an eye drop solution to reduce intraocular pressure, or pressure in the eyes. It is also used in tablet form as a drug to treat hypertension. Timolol was first approved by the FDA in 1978. This drug is marketed by several manufacturers and is an effective agent for the management of conditions such as open-angle glaucoma and hypertension. Timolol competes with adrenergic neurotransmitters for binding to beta(1)-adrenergic receptors in the heart and the beta(2)-receptors in the vascular and bronchial smooth muscle. This leads to diminished actions of catecholamines, which normally bind to adrenergic receptors and exert sympathetic effects leading to an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. Beta(1)-receptor blockade by timolol leads to a decrease in both heart rate and cardiac output during rest and exercise, and a decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In addition to this, a reduction in reflex orthostatic hypotension may also occur. The blockade of beta(2) receptors by timolol in the blood vessels leads to a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance, reducing blood pressure. The plasma protein binding of timolol is not extensive and is estimated to be about 10%. Timolol, when administered by the ophthalmic route, rapidly reduces intraocular pressure. When administered in the tablet form, it reduces blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output, and decreases sympathetic activity.. This drug has a fast onset of action, usually occurring within 20 minutes of the administration of an ophthalmic dose. Timolol maleate can exert pharmacological actions for as long as 24 hours if given in the 0.5% or 0.25% doses.  Ophthalmic timolol is indicated for the treatment of increased intraocular pressure in patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma. The oral form of this drug is used to treat high blood pressure. In certain cases, timolol is used in the prevention of migraine headaches. \"\n",

Celecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) which is known for its decreased risk of causing gastrointestinal bleeding compared to other NSAIDS. It is used to manage symptoms of various types of arthritis pain and in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) to reduce precancerous polyps in the colon. It is marketed by Pfizer under the brand name Celebrex, and was initially granted FDA approval in 1998.  Unlike most NSAIDs, which inhibit both types of cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2), celecoxib is a selective noncompetitive inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme. COX-2 is expressed heavily in inflamed tissues where it is induced by inflammatory mediators. The inhibition of this enzyme reduces the synthesis of metabolites that include prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), prostacyclin (PGI2), thromboxane (TXA2), prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), and prostaglandin F2 (PGF2). Resultant inhibition of these mediators leads to the alleviation of pain and inflammation.  The protein binding of celecoxib is 97%, and it is primarily bound to albumin.  Celecoxib is indicated for symptomatic treatment of adult osteoarthritis (OA) and adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Celecoxib is not a substitute for aspirin for cardiovascular event prophylaxis. \"\n",

      "Vinblastine_(15107),\"Vinblastine belongs to drug node. Antitumor alkaloid isolated from Vinca rosea. (Merck, 11th ed.) The antitumor activity of vinblastine is thought to be due primarily to inhibition of mitosis at metaphase through its interaction with tubulin. Vinblastine binds to the microtubular proteins of the mitotic spindle, leading to crystallization of the microtubule and mitotic arrest or cell death. 98-99% Vinblastine is a vinca alkaloid antineoplastic agent. The vinca alkaloids are structurally similar compounds comprised of 2 multiringed units: vindoline and catharanthine. The vinca alkaloids have become clinically useful since the discovery of their antitumour properties in 1959. Initially, extracts of the periwinkle plant (<i>Catharanthus roseus</i>) were investigated because of putative hypoglycemic properties, but were noted to cause marrow suppression in rats and antileukemic effects <i>in vitro</i>. Vinblastine has some immunosuppressant effect. The vinca alkaloids are considered to be cell cycle phase-specific.

      "Doxazosin_(15108),\"Doxazosin belongs to drug node. Doxazosin is an alpha-1 antagonist used for the treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) symptoms and hypertension. Other members of this drug class include , , , and. Because of its long-lasting effects, doxazosin can be administered once a day. It is marketed by Pfizer and was initially approved by the FDA in 1990. Doxazosin selectively inhibits the postsynaptic alpha-1 receptors on vascular smooth muscle by nonselectively blocking the alpha-1a, alpha-1b, and alpha-1d subtypes. This action on blood vessels decreases systemic peripheral vascular resistance, reducing blood pressure, exerting minimal effects on the heart rate due to its receptor selectivity. Norepinephrine-activated alpha-1 receptors located on the prostate gland and bladder neck normally cause contraction of regional muscular tissue, obstructing urinary flow and contributing to the symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy. Alpha-1 antagonism causes smooth muscle relaxation in the prostate and bladder, effectively relieving urinary frequency, urgency, weak urinary stream, and other unpleasant effects of BPH. Recently, doxazosin was found to cause apoptosis of hERG potassium channels in an in vitro setting, possibly contributing to a risk of heart failure with doxazosin use.  The plasma protein binding of doxazosin is estimated at 98%.. It has also been shown to be bound to the alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. Doxazosin decreases standing and supine blood pressure and relieves the symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy through the inhibition of alpha-1 receptors. Doxazosin is indicated to treat the symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, which may include urinary frequency, urgency, and nocturia, among other symptoms. In addition, doxazosin is indicated alone or in combination with various antihypertensive agents for the management of hypertension. Off-label uses of doxazosin include the treatment of pediatric hypertension and the treatment of ureteric calculi.\"\n",

Galantamine is a tertiary alkaloid and reversible, competitive inhibitor of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme, which is a widely studied therapeutic target used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. First characterized in the early 1950s, galantamine is a tertiary alkaloid that was extracted from botanical sources, such as _Galanthus nivalis_. Galantamine was first studied in paralytic and neuropathic conditions, such as myopathies and postpolio paralytic conditions, and for reversal of neuromuscular blockade. Following the discovery of its AChE-inhibiting properties, the cognitive effects of galantamine were studied in a wide variety of psychiatric disorders such as mild cognitive impairment, cognitive impairment in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and autism; however, re-development of the drug for Alzheimer’s disease did not commence until the early 1990s due to difficulties in extraction and synthesis. Galantamine blocks the breakdown of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, thereby increasing acetylcholine neurotransmission. It also acts as an allosteric modulator of the nicotinic receptor, giving its dual mechanism of action clinical significance. Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by progressive, irreversible degeneration of acetylcholine-producing neurons, cognitive impairment, and the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques. The cholinergic system plays a critical role in memory, alongside other important neural functions such as attention, learning, stress response, wakefulness and sleep, and sensory information. Studies show that acetylcholine (ACh) is involved in the modulation of acquisition, encoding, consolidation, reconsolidation, extinction, and retrieval of memory. The gradual loss of cholinergic neurons in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) may, therefore, contribute to the memory loss exhibited by AD patients.  The plasma protein binding of galantamine is 18% at therapeutically relevant concentrations. Galantamine is a competitive and reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase that works to increase acetylcholine levels. Galantamine acts both centrally and peripherally to inhibit both muscle and brain acetylcholinesterase, thereby increasing cholinergic tone. Galantamine is also a positive allosteric modulator of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. As dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, galatamine has a negligible effect in altering the course of the underlying process of dementia and may exert its therapeutic effectiveness for a short period of time. However, galantamine promoted improvements in cognition, global function, activities of daily living, and behavioural symptoms in clinical studies of Alzheimer’s disease. Galantamine is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer’s type.\"\n",
      "Paroxetine_(15116),\"Paroxetine belongs to drug node. Paroxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) drug commonly known as Paxil. It has a variety of uses, including the treatment of anxiety disorders, major depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and symptoms of menopause, among others. It was approved by the FDA in the early 1990s and marketed by SmithKline Beecham. A unique feature of this drug is that it is highly potent and selective in its inhibition of serotonin reuptake and has little effect on other neurotransmitters. Because of its potent inhibition of serotonin reuptake, paroxetine is more likely to cause withdrawal effects upon cessation. Paroxetine is well tolerated in most patients with a similar adverse effect profile to other members of its drug class. The controlled release formulation was designed to decrease the likelihood of nausea that is sometimes associated with paroxetine. Paroxetine enhances serotonergic activity via the inhibition presynaptic reuptake of serotonin by the serotonin (SERT) receptor. This inhibition raises the level of serotonin in the synaptic cleft, relieving various symptoms. This drug has been demonstrated to be a stronger inhibitor of serotonin reuptake than other members of the same drug class, including , , and. The mechanism of action of paroxetine in relieving the vasomotor symptoms of menopause is unknown, according to the Brisdelle prescribing information, but may occur due to its effects on thermoregulation. Paroxetine is 95% bound to plasma proteins. Paroxetine treats the symptoms of depression, various anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and the vasomotor symptoms of menopause via the inhibition of serotonin reuptake. The onset of action of paroxetine is reported to be approximately 6 weeks. Paroxetine is indicated for the management of depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder. One form of paroxetine, commercially known as Brisdelle, is used to manage mild to moderate vasomotor symptoms of menopause. Off-label, paroxetine may be used for the treatment of premature ejaculation or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\"\n",
      "Trimipramine_(15117),\"Trimipramine belongs to drug node. Tricyclic antidepressant similar to imipramine, but with more antihistaminic and sedative properties. Trimipramine's mechanism of action differs from other tricyclic antidepressants. Trimipramine acts by decreasing the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin (5-HT). 93%-96% (to plasma proteins) Trimipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant. It was thought that tricyclic antidepressants work by inhibiting the re-uptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin by nerve cells. However, this response occurs immediately, yet mood does not lift for around two weeks. It is now thought that changes occur in receptor sensitivity in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The hippocampus is part of the limbic system, a part of the brain involved in emotions. Presynaptic receptors are affected: a1 and b1 receptors are sensitized, a2 receptors are desensitised (leading to increased noradrenaline production). Tricyclics are also known as effective analgesics for different types of pain, especially neuropathic or neuralgic pain. A precise mechanism for their analgesic action is unknown, but it is thought that they modulate anti-pain opioid systems in the CNS via an indirect serotonergic route. They are also effective in migraine prophylaxis, but not in abortion of acute migraine attack. The mechanism of their anti-migraine action is also thought to be serotonergic. For the treatment of depression and depression accompanied by anxiety, agitation or sleep disturbance\"\n",

      "Loperamide_(15125),\"Loperamide belongs to drug node. One of the long-acting synthetic antidiarrheals; it is not significantly absorbed from the gut, and has no effect on the adrenergic system or central nervous system, but may antagonize histamine and interfere with acetylcholine release locally. <i>In vitro</i> and animal studies show that Loperamide acts by slowing intestinal motility and by affecting water and electrolyte movement through the bowel. Loperamide inhibits peristaltic activity by a direct effect on the circular and longitudinal muscles of the intestinal wall. It is a non-selective calcium channel blocker and binds to opioid mu-receptors. Evidence also suggests that at higher concentrations it binds to calmodulin. 97% Loperamide is a synthetic anti-diarrheal indicated for the control and symptomatic relief of acute nonspecific diarrhea and of chronic diarrhea associated with inflammatory bowel disease. Loperamide is also indicated for reducing the volume of discharge from ileostomies. In man, Loperamide prolongs the transit time of the intestinal contents. It reduces the daily fecal volume, increases the viscosity and bulk density, and diminishes the loss of fluid and electrolytes. Tolerance to the antidiarrheal effect has not been observed. Loperamide is an opioid receptor agonist and acts on the mu opioid receptors in the myenteric plexus large intestines; it does not affect the central nervous system like other opioids. It works specifically by decreasing the activity of the myenteric plexus which decreases the motility of the circular and longitudinal smooth muscles of the intestinal wall. This increases the amount of time substances stay in the intestine, allowing for more water to be absorbed out of the fecal matter. Loperamide also decreases colonic mass movements and suppresses the gastrocolic reflex. For the control and symptomatic relief of acute nonspecific diarrhea and of chronic diarrhea associated with inflammatory bowel disease or gastroenteritis. Also used for reducing the volume of discharge from ileostomies.\"\n",

By inhibiting the acetylcholinesterase enzyme, donepezil improves the cognitive and behavioral signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease, which may include apathy, aggression, confusion, and psychosis. Donepezil is indicated for the management of mild to moderate Alzheimer’s Disease at doses of 5 mg or 10 mg. It is also indicated for the management of moderate to severe Alzheimer’s Disease in a higher dose of 10 mg or 23 mg administered once daily. Off-label uses include the management of vascular dementia, Parkinson's Disease-associated dementia, and Lewy body dementia, among others. When combined with memantine, the extended-release form of donepezil is indicated to treat the symptoms of moderate to severe dementia.\"\n",
      "Tipranavir_(15130),\"Tipranavir belongs to drug node. Tipranavir is a sulfonamide-containing dyhydropyrone and a nonpeptidic protease inhibitor that targets the HIV protease. Tipranavir and ritonavir are coadministered to treat HIV. Tipranavir (TPV) is a non-peptidic HIV-1 protease inhibitor that inhibits the processing of the viral Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins in HIV-1 infected cells, thus preventing formation of mature virions. Two mechanisms are suggested in regards to the potency of tipranavir: 1. Tipravanir may bind to the active site of the protease enzyme with fewer hydrogen bonds than peptidic protease inhibitors, which results in increased flexibility, allowing it to fit into the active site of the enzyme in viruses that have become resistance to other protease inhibitors. This also enables tipranavir to adjust to amino acid substitutions at the active site. 2. Tipranavir's strong hydrogen bonding interaction with the amide backbone of the protease active site Asp30 may lead to its activity against resistant viruses. Extensive (> 99.9%), to both human serum albumin and &alpha;-1-acid glycoprotein. Tipranavir is a non-peptidic protease inhibitor (PI) of HIV. Protease inhibitors block the part of HIV called protease. HIV-1 protease is an enzyme required for the proteolytic cleavage of the viral polyprotein precursors into the individual functional proteins found in infectious HIV-1. Nelfinavir binds to the protease active site and inhibits the activity of the enzyme. This inhibition prevents cleavage of the viral polyproteins resulting in the formation of immature non-infectious viral particles. Protease inhibitors are almost always used in combination with at least two other anti-HIV drugs. For combination antiretroviral treatment of HIV-1 infected adult patients with evidence of viral replication, who are highly treatment-experienced or have HIV-1 strains resistant to multiple protease inhibitors.\"\n",
      "Selegiline_(15138),\"Selegiline belongs to drug node. A selective, irreversible inhibitor of Type B monoamine oxidase. It is used in newly diagnosed patients with Parkinson's disease. It may slow progression of the clinical disease and delay the requirement for levodopa therapy. It also may be given with levodopa upon onset of disability. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p385) The compound without isomeric designation is Deprenyl. Although the mechanisms for selegiline's beneficial action in the treatment of Parkinson's disease are not fully understood, the selective, irreversible inhibition of monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) is thought to be of primary importance. MAO-B is involved in the oxidative deamination of dopamine in the brain. Selegiline binds to MAO-B within the nigrostriatal pathways in the central nervous system, thus blocking microsomal metabolism of dopamine and enhancing the dopaminergic activity in the substantial nigra. Selegiline may also increase dopaminergic activity through mechanisms other than inhibition of MAO-B. At higher doses, selegiline can also inhibit monozmine oxidase type A (MAO-A), allowing it to be used for the treatment of depression. > 99.5% Dopamine is an essential chemical that occurs in many parts of the body. It is the premature degradation of dopamine that results in the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is an enzyme which accelerates the breakdown of dopamine. Selegiline can prolong the effects of dopamine in the brain by preventing its breakdown through seletively blocking MAO-B. It also may prevent the removal of dopamine between nerve endings and enhance release of dopamine from nerve cells. Monotherapy for initial treatment of Parkinson's disease, as well as an adjunct therapy in patients with a decreased response to levodopa/carbadopa. Also used for the palliative treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease and at higher doses, for the treatment of depression.\"\n",

It is manufactured and distributed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration on January 31, 2012, and by Health Canada in late 2012. Ivacaftor is administered as a monotherapy and also administered in combination with other drugs for the management of CF. A wide variety of CFTR mutations correlate to the Cystic Fibrosis phenotype and are associated with differing levels of disease severity. The most common mutation, affecting approximately 70% of patients with CF worldwide, is known as F508del-CFTR or delta-F508 (ΔF508), in which a deletion in the amino acid phenylalanine at position 508 results in impaired production of the CFTR protein, thereby causing a significant reduction in the amount of ion transporter present on cell membranes. Ivacaftor as monotherapy has failed to show a benefit for patients with delta-F508 mutations, most likely due to an insufficient amount of protein available at the cell membrane for interaction and potentiation by the drug. The next most common mutation, G551D, affecting 4-5% of CF patients worldwide is characterized as a missense mutation, whereby there is sufficient amount of protein at the cell surface, but opening and closing mechanisms of the channel are altered. Ivacaftor is indicated for the management of CF in patients with this second type of mutation, as it binds to and potentiates the channel opening ability of CFTR proteins on the cell membrane. About 99% of ivacaftor is bound to plasma proteins, primarily to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin. The use of Ivacaftor has been shown to both improve CF symptoms and modulate underlying disease pathology. This is achieved by potentiating the channel opening probability (or gating) of CFTR protein in patients with impaired gating mechanisms. This is in contrast to , another CF medication, that functions by preventing misfolding of the CFTR protein and thereby results in increased processing and trafficking of mature protein to the cell surface.  When used as monotherapy as the product Kalydeco, ivacaftor is indicated for the management of CF in patients age 2 years and older who have a mutation in the CFTR gene that is responsive to ivacaftor potentiation. Ivacaftor received expanded approval in May 2017 for the following 33 CFTR mutations: E56K, P67L, R74W, D110E, D110H, R117C, R117H, G178R, E193K, L206W, R347H, R352Q, A455E, S549N, S549R, G551D, G551S, D579G, S945L, S977F, F1052V, K1060T, A1067T, G1069R, R1070Q, R1070W, F1074L, D1152H, G1244E, S1251N, S1255P, D1270N, and G1349D.\"\n",

      "Pitavastatin_(14402),\"Pitavastatin belongs to drug node. Pitavastatin, also known as the brand name product Livalo, is a lipid-lowering drug belonging to the statin class of medications. By inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol within the liver, statins lower abnormal cholesterol and lipid levels and ultimately reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid. This is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as \\bad cholesterol\\\"\"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.\"\" Pitavastatin is a statin medication and a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Pitavastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increase hepatic uptake of LDL, thereby reducing circulating LDL-C levels.  Pitavstatin is more than 99% protein bound in human plasma, mainly to albumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. Pitavastatin is an oral antilipemic agent which inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, rosuvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Pitavastatin is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia to reduce elevated total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), triglycerides (TG), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). It is also indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 8 years and older with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) to reduce elevated TC, LDL-C, and Apo B.\"\n",
      "Rilpivirine_(14403),\"Rilpivirine belongs to drug node. Rilpivirine is non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) which is used for the treatment of HIV-1 infections in treatment-naive patients. It is a diarylpyrimidine derivative, a class of molecules that resemble pyrimidine nucleotides found in DNA. The internal conformational flexibility of rilpivirine and the plasticity of it interacting binding site gives it a very high potency and an unlikely generation of resistance compared to other NNRTI's. Rilpivirine was developed by Tilbotec, Inc. and FDA approved on May 20, 2011. On November 21, 2017, Rilpivirine, in combination with dolutegravir, was approved as part of the first complete treatment regimen with only two drugs for the treatment of adults with HIV-1 named Juluca. Rilpivirine is a non-competitive NNRTI that binds to reverse transcriptase. Its binding results in the blockage of RNA and DNA- dependent DNA polymerase activities, like HIV-1 replication. It does not present activity against human DNA polymerases α, β and γ. Rilpivirine binds to the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and its flexible structure around the aromatic rings allows the adaptation to changes in the non-nucleoside RT binding pocket. Rilpivirine is highly protein-bound thus, >99% of its dose can be bound to plasma protein in a concentration-dependent manner. The most important plasma binding proteins is albumin. Ripivirine treatment produces a significant and effective reduction in the viral load based on the study of HIV-1 RNA copies per ml or immunologic changes by the determination of counts of CD4+ and CD8+ cells. The combition therapy (ripivirine and dolutegravir) presented the same viral supression found in previous three-drug therapies without integrase strand transfer inhibitor mutations or rilpivirine resistance. Rilpivirine, in combination with other agents, is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infections in antiretroviral treatment-naive patients with HIV-1 RNA ≤100,000 copies/mL and CD4+ cell count >200 cells/mm3. The FDA combination therapy approval of rilpivirine and dolutegravir is indicated for adults with HIV-1 infections whose virus is currently suppressed (< 50 copies/ml) on a stable regimen for at least six months, without history of treatment failure and no known substitutions associated to resistance to any of the two components of the therapy.\"\n",
      "Vemurafenib_(14405),\"Vemurafenib belongs to drug node. Vemurafenib is a competitive kinase inhibitor with activity against BRAF kinase with mutations like V600E. It exerts its function by binding to the ATP-binding domain of the mutant BRAF. Vemurafenib was co-developed by Roche and Plexxikon and it obtained its FDA approval on August 17, 2011, under the company Hoffmann La Roche. After approval, Roche in collaboration with Genentech launched a broad development program.  Vemurafenib is an orally available inhibitor of mutated BRAF-serine-threonine kinase. Vemurafenif is a small molecule that interacts as a competitive inhibitor of the mutated species of BRAF. It is especially potent against the BRAF V600E mutation. Vemurafenib blocks downstream processes to inhibit tumour growth and eventually trigger apoptosis. Vemurafenib does not have antitumour effects against melanoma cell lines with the wild-type BRAF mutation. Vemurafenib highly binds to plasma proteins where >99% of the administered dose will be found protein bound to serum albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. BRAF activation results in cell growth, proliferation, and metastasis. BRAF is an intermediary molecule in MAPK whose activation depends on ERK activation, elevation of cyclin D1 and cellular proliferation. The mutation V600E produces a constitutively form of BRAF. Vemurafenib has been shown to reduce all activation markers related to BRAF; in clinical trials, vemurafenib treatment showed a reduction of cytoplasmic phosphorylated ERK and a cell proliferation driven by Ki-67. Studies also reported decrease in MAPK-related metabolic activity. All the different reports indicate thet Vemurafenib generates an almost complete inhibition of the MAPK pathway.  Vemurafenib is approved since 2011 for the treatment of metastatic melanoma with a mutation on BRAF in the valine located in the exon 15 at codon 600, this mutation is denominated as V600E. The V600E mutation, a substitution of glutamic acid for valine, accounts for 54% of the cases of cutaneous melanoma. \"\n",

It is an alternative to antimuscarinic drugs for this indication. FDA approved on June 28, 2012. Mirabegron is a potent and selective agonist for beta-3 adrenergic receptors. Once beta-3 receptors are activated, the detrusor smooth muscle relaxes to allow for a larger bladder capacity. At higher doses (200 mg), there is a potential for mirabegron to activate beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors.  71% bound to plasma proteins. It binds to albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein with moderate affinity.  Mirabegron has little effect on the mean maximum flow rate or mean detrusor pressure at maximum flow rate in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms and bladder outlet obstruction. Furthermore, mirabegron increases blood pressure in a dose dependent manner. However, this effect is reversible when mirabegron is discontinued. Mirabegron also increases heart rate in a dose dependent manner. The dose in which half-maximal efficacy is demonstrated is 25 mg. Comparatively, the dose in which maximal efficacy is demonstrated is 100 mg.

      "Palbociclib_(14412),\"Palbociclib belongs to drug node. Palbociclib is a piperazine pyridopyrimidine that acts in the cell cycle machinery. It is a second generation cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor selected from a group of pyridopyrimidine compounds due to its favorable physical and pharmaceutical properties. Palbociclib is a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor that acts by binding to the ATP pocket with an IC50 in the range of 9-15 nmol/L. It is important to consider that it presents low to absent activity against other kinases.  Binding of palbociclib to human plasma proteins in vitro accounts for approximately 85% of the administered dose. Due to its mechanism of action, palbociclib inhibits cell growth and suppresses DNA replication in retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene (RB) proficient cancer cells. As expected, these RB cells present a significant increase in the proportion of cells in G1 state and the presence of palbociclib produces effective dephosphorylation of RB, reduce proliferation and induce senescence causing cell-cycle arrest.

      "Nintedanib_(14413),\"Nintedanib belongs to drug node. Nintedanib is a small molecule kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis, systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It was first approved for use in the United States in 2014. Within the spectrum of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis treatment options, nintedanib is currently one of only two disease-modifying therapies available and indicated for the condition (the other being ) and as such is used as a first-line treatment following diagnosis to slow down the progressive loss of lung function. As a chemotherapeutic agent for NSCLC, nintedanib, in combination with , is reserved for patients who have tried and failed first-line chemotherapeutic options. Nintedanib is a small molecule, competitive, triple angiokinase inhibitor that targets multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (nRTKs). Many of these RTKs are implicated in lung fibrosis and tumour angiogenesis, so nintedanib is therefore used in the treatment of proliferative diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, non-small cell lung cancer, and systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease. The specific RTKs that nintedanib inhibits are platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFR) α and β, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1-3, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 1-3, and Fns-Like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3). Nintedanib binds to the ATP-binding pocket of these receptors and inhibits their activity, thereby blocking signalling cascades that result in the proliferation and migration of lung fibroblasts. Nintedanib also inhibits kinase signalling pathways in various cells within tumour tissues, including endothelial cells, pericytes, smooth muscle cells, and cells contributing to angiogenesis, culminating in an inhibition of cell proliferation and apoptosis of affected tumour cells. Plasma protein binding of nintedanib is high, with a bound fraction of 97.8%. Albumin is thought to be the major binding protein. Nintedanib is a small molecule kinase inhibitor that inhibits upstream kinase activity to ultimately inhibit lung fibroblast proliferation and migration, as well as signalling pathways that promote the proliferation and survival of endothelial and perivascular cells in tumour tissues. In the US, nintedanib is indicated for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and to slow declining pulmonary function in patients with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease. In the EU, nintedanib is indicated in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic, locally advanced, or locally recurrent non-small cell lung cancer of adenocarcinoma histology who have already tried first-line therapy.\"\n",

The names S-amlodipine and levamlodipine may be used interchangeably as both substances are the same, however. As a racemic mixture, amlodipine contains (R) and (S)-amlodipine isomers, but only (S)-amlodipine as the active moiety possesses therapeutic activity. Levamlodipine blocks the transmembrane influx of calcium through L-type calcium channels into the vascular and cardiac smooth muscles resulting in vasodilation and a subsequent decrease in blood pressure. Levamlodipine inhibits calcium influx in vascular smooth muscle to a greater degree than in cardiac muscle, leading to decreased peripheral vascular resistance and lowered blood pressure. In vitro studies have shown a negative inotropic effect but this is unlikely to be clinically relevant. Levamlodipine is 93% protein bound in plasma, largely to human serum albumin. Levamlodipine inhibits L-type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle, reducing peripheral vascular resistance and blood pressure. It is given once daily in doses of 1.25-2.5mg in children and 2.5-5mg in adults.

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as ledipasvir. More specifically, ledipasvir is an inhibitor of the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Non-Structural Protein 5A (NS5A), which is required for viral RNA replication and assembly of HCV virions. Although its exact mechanism of action is unknown, it is postulated to prevent hyperphosphorylation of NS5A which is required for viral protein production. It is effective against genotypes 1a, 1b, 4a, and 5a and with a lesser activity against genotypes 2a and 3a of HCV. Ledipasvir and other direct acting antivirals are very potent options for the treatment of Hepatitis C, as they exhibit a high barrier to the development of resistance. This is an important advantage relative to HCV drugs that target other viral enzymes such as the protease, for which rapid development of resistance has proven to be an important cause of therapeutic failure.  Ledipasvir is an inhibitor of the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) NS5A protein required for viral RNA replication and assembly of HCV virions.

Sarecycline is a semi-synthetic derivative of tetracycline that was initially discovered by Paratek Pharmaceuticals from Boston, MA but then licensed to Warner Chilcott of Rockaway, NJ in July of 2007. After completing various phase-II and phase-III trials demonstrating its effectiveness in treating moderate to severe facial acne vulgaris the US Food and Drug Administration approved Barcelona based Almirall, S.A.'s Seysara (sarecylcine) as a new first in class narrow spectrum tetracycline derived oral antibiotic for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients nine years of age and older. Seysara (sarecycline) was originally part of Allergan's US Medical Dermatology portfolio, before Almirall acquired the portfolio in the second half of 2018 as a means of consolidating and reinforcing the dermatology-focused pharmaceutical company's presence in the United States. It has been demonstrated that tetracyclines like sarecycline elicit their antimicrobial action by targeting and inhibiting protein synthesis in microbial agents like Cutibacterium acnes present in acne lesions. In particular, it is believed that sarecycline's mechanism of action revolves around the inhibition of various macromolecular biosynthesis activities like the macromolecular biosynthesis of microbial DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids, and cell wall. Specifically, it has been observed that while sarecycline demonstrates appreciable inhibition of microbial macromolecular DNA and protein synthesis, the compound has little to no effect on lipid biosynthesis, cell wall synthesis, and RNA synthesis. In addition, because Cutibacterium acnes also generates proteins and enzymes that are capable of causing inflammation, it is also believed that tetracyclines like sarecyclines can also affect an anti-inflammatory effect via the inhibition of such microbial protein synthesis. The protein binding of sarecycline has been recorded as ranging from 62.5% to 74.7% in vitro. Compared to various examples of first-line tetracycline therapies for moderate to severe acne like doxycycline and minocycline, studies have shown that sarecycline can be sixteen to thirty-two fold less active against aerobic Gram-negative bacilli present within the normal human intestinal microbiome. Furthermore, it has also been demonstrated that sarecycline may be four to eight fold less active against various anaerobic bacteria that also comprise the normal human intestinal microbiome. Subsequently, while doxycycline and minocycline typically elicit broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity that can often cause adverse effects like diarrhea, fungal overgrowth, vaginal candidiasis, etc. due to undesirable off-target antibacterial effects on endogenous intestinal flora, sarecycline demonstrates a noticeably more target specific narrow spectrum activity with lower incidence of such side effects.

This gene encodes the ghrelin-obestatin preproprotein that is cleaved to yield two peptides, ghrelin and obestatin. Ghrelin is a powerful appetite stimulant and plays an important role in energy homeostasis. Its secretion is initiated when the stomach is empty, whereupon it binds to the growth hormone secretagogue receptor in the hypothalamus which results in the secretion of growth hormone (somatotropin). Ghrelin is thought to regulate multiple activities, including hunger, reward perception via the mesolimbic pathway, gastric acid secretion, gastrointestinal motility, and pancreatic glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. It was initially proposed that obestatin plays an opposing role to ghrelin by promoting satiety and thus decreasing food intake, but this action is still debated. Recent reports suggest multiple metabolic roles for obestatin, including regulating adipocyte function and glucose metabolism. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

Among the many uses are as an anesthetic premedication, in urinary incontinence, in motion sickness, as an antispasmodic, and as a mydriatic and cycloplegic. Scopolamine acts by interfering with the transmission of nerve impulses by acetylcholine in the parasympathetic nervous system (specifically the vomiting center).  Scopolamine is a muscarinic antagonist structurally similar to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and acts by blocking the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and is thus classified as an anticholinergic. Scopolamine has many uses including the prevention of motion sickness. It is not clear how Scopolamine prevents nausea and vomiting due to motion sickness. The vestibular part of the ear is very important for balance. When a person becomes disoriented due to motion, the vestibule sends a signal through nerves to the vomiting center in the brain, and vomiting occurs. Acetylcholine is a chemical that nerves use to transmit messages to each other. It is believe that Scopolamine prevents communication between the nerves of the vestibule and the vomiting center in the brain by blocking the action of acetylcholine. Scopolamine also may work directly on the vomiting center. Scopolamine must be taken before the onset of motion sickness to be effective.

This amino acid is an essential amino acid, which means that humans cannot synthesize it. Its codons are AAA and AAG. L-Lysine is a base, as are arginine and histidine. The ε-amino group acts as a site for hydrogen binding and a general base in catalysis. Common posttranslational modifications include methylation of the ε-amino group, giving methyl-, dimethyl-, and trimethyllysine. The latter occurs in calmodulin. Other posttranslational modifications include acetylation. Collagen contains hydroxylysine which is derived from lysine by lysyl hydroxylase. O-Glycosylation of lysine residues in the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus is used to mark certain proteins for secretion from the cell. Proteins of the herpes simplex virus are rich in L-arginine, and tissue culture studies indicate an enhancing effect on viral replication when the amino acid ratio of L-arginine to L-lysine is high in the tissue culture media. When the ratio of L-lysine to L-arginine is high, viral replication and the cytopathogenicity of herpes simplex virus have been found to be inhibited. L-lysine may facilitate the absorption of calcium from the small intestine.  Insures the adequate absorption of calcium; helps form collagen ( which makes up bone cartilage &amp; connective tissues); aids in the production of antibodies, hormones &amp; enzymes. Recent studies have shown that Lysine may be effective against herpes by improving the balance of nutrients that reduce viral growth. A deficiency may result in tiredness, inability to concentrate, irritability, bloodshot eyes, retarded growth, hair loss, anemia &amp; reproductive problems. Supplemental L-lysine has putative anti-herpes simplex virus activity. There is preliminary research suggesting that it may have some anti-osteoporotic activity.\"\n",

Lumacaftor is a drug used in combination with as the fixed dose combination product Orkambi for the management of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older. Cystic Fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by one of several different mutations in the gene for the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) protein, a transmembrane ion channel involved in the transport of chloride and sodium ions across cell membranes of the lungs, pancreas, and other organs. Mutations in the CFTR gene result in altered production, misfolding, or function of the CFTR protein and consequently abnormal fluid and ion transport across cell membranes. As a result, CF patients produce thick, sticky mucus that clogs the ducts of organs where it is produced making patients more susceptible to infections, lung damage, pancreatic insufficiency, and malnutrition. Lumacaftor improves CF symptoms and underlying disease pathology by aiding the conformational stability of F508del-mutated CFTR proteins, preventing misfolding and resulting in increased processing and trafficking of mature protein to the cell surface.  Lumacaftor improves CF symptoms and underlying disease pathology by aiding the conformational stability of F508del-mutated CFTR, resulting in increased processing and trafficking of mature protein to the cell surface. More specifically, lumacaftor acts as a protein-folding chaperone, preventing misfolding of CFTR ion channels and consequent destruction during processing in the endoplasmic reticulum.  Lumacaftor is extensively protein bound in the plasma (99%), and binds primarily to albumin. Results from clinical trials indicated that treatment with Orkambi (lumacaftor/ ) results in improved lung function, reduced chance of experiencing a pulmonary exacerbation, reduced sweat chloride, increased weight gain, and improvements in CF symptoms and quality of life. When given in combination with as the fixed dose combination product Orkambi, lumacaftor is indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients age 6 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. \"\n",

Tenofovir alafenamide is a novel prodrug developed in order to improve renal safety when compared to the counterpart. Both of these prodrugs were first created to cover the polar phosphonic acid group on tenofovir by using a novel oxycarbonyloxymethyl linkers to improve the oral bioavailability and intestinal diffusion. Tenofovir alafenamide is an alanine ester form characterized for presenting low systemic levels but high intracellular concentration. It has been reported to produce a large antiviral efficacy at doses ten times lower than tenofovir disoproxil. Tenofovir alafenamide is indicated to treat chronic hepatitis B, treat HIV-1, and prevent HIV-1 infections. Tenofovir alafenamide presents 91% lower plasma concentration with an intracellular presence of about 20-fold higher when compared to. This is due to its prolonged systemic exposure and its higher intracellular accumulation of the active metabolite tenofovir diphosphate. Tenofovir alafenamide is reported to bind to plasma proteins and _ex vivo_ studies have registered that approximately 80% of the administered dose of this drug is presented in a bound state. Tenofovir alafenamide has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of hepatitis B viral replication.

      "Grazoprevir_(14443),\"Grazoprevir belongs to drug node. Grazoprevir is a direct acting antiviral medication used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as Grazoprevir. Grazoprevir is an inhibitor of NS3/4A, a serine protease enzyme, encoded by HCV genotypes 1 and 4. These enzymes are essential for viral replication and serve to cleave the virally encoded polyprotein into mature proteins like NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B. The barrier for develoment of resistance to NS3/4A inhibitors is lower than that of NS5B inhibitors, another class of DAAs. Subtitutions at amino acid positions 155, 156, or 168 are known to confer resistance. The substitutions of the enzyme's catalytic triad consisting of H58, D82, and S139 are also likely to alter the affinity of the drug for NS3/4A or the activity of the enzyme itself. Despite this disadvantage Grazoprevir is still effective against HCV particularly when paired with. Grazoprevir is a second generation NS3/4a protease inhibitor used to inhibit viral HCV replication. NS3/4a protease is an integral part of viral replication and mediates the cleavage the virally encoded polyprotein to mature proteins (NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B). Grazoprevir inhibits the NS3/4protease enzymes of HCV genotype 1a, 1B, and 4 with IC50 values of 7pM, 4pM, and 62pM, respectively. Grazoprevir is more than 98.8% bound to plasma proteins. It binds both human serum albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein. Grazoprevir is classified as a direct-acting antiviral (DAA) and prevents viral replication in HCV genotypes 1a, 1b, and 4. Grazoprevir is indicated in combination with (as the fixed dose combination product Zepatier) with or without for treatment of chronic HCV genotypes 1a, 1b, or 4 infection in adults. \"\n",
      "Vinflunine_(14446),\"Vinflunine belongs to drug node. Vinflunine is a third-generation member of the vinca alkaloid family with anti-tumour actions. It was first described in 1998 at the Pierre Fabre research center in France. Like other vinca agents, vinflunine is an anti-mitotic agent that induces a cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and promotes cell death via apoptosis. Vinflunine is a microtubule inhibitor that binds to tubulin at or near to the vinca binding sites to inhibits its polymerization into microtubules during cell proliferation. In murine tumors and human tumor xenografts, vinflunine exhibits an antitumor efficacy than , , and.  Microtubules are a major component of the cytoskeleton that have a critical role in maintece of cell shape, mobility, adhesion and intracellular integrity. They also play a role in the formation of the mitotic spindle and chromosomal segregation to the daughter cells at mitosis. Via GTP hydrolysis at the β-tubulin subunit and polymerization of tubulin into linear polymers, microtubules, or macromolecular filaments composed of tubulin heterodimers, are formed via a mechanism of nucleation-elongation. At the onset of mitosis, the interphase microtubule network disassembles into the tubulin. The tubulin reassembles into a new population of mitotic spindle microtubules that further undergo rapid successions of lengthening and shortening until they are attached to the newly duplicated sister chromatids at their centromeres. The dynamic behaviour of microtubules are characterized by two mechanical process: dynamic instability indicating repeated switches of growth and shortening at the ends, and microtubule treadmilling that involves the fast-growing (+) end of the microtubule accompanied by a net loss of the opposite slow-growing (-) end. Microtubule treadmilling plays a critical role in mitosis by generating the forces for separation of the chromosomes in the mitotic spindle from centrosome and kinetochores.  Vinflunine is 67.2 ± 1.1% bound to human plasma proteins. It mainly binds to high density lipoproteins and serum albumin, and is non-saturable on the range of vinflunine concentrations observed in patients.. Binding to alpha-1 acid glycoprotein and to platelets is negligible (< 5%). The antitumour effects of vinflunine are dependent on concentration and exposure duration of the drug. Vinflunine mediates an anti-mitotic action by inhibiting the microtubule assembly at micromolar concentrations and reducing the rate and extent of microtubule growing events. _In vivo_, vinflunine displays a significant antitumor activity against a broad spectrum of human xenografts in mice both in terms of survival prolongation and tumour growth inhibition. Compared with other vinca alkaloids, vinflunine is a less-potent inductor of drug resistance _in vitro_.  For use as a monotherapy in adults with advanced or transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract after failure of a prior platinum-containing therapy. \"\n",
      "Selumetinib_(14449),\"Selumetinib belongs to drug node. Activation of the Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway is known to be implemented in several types of maligcies, thus, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors such as selumetinib are important tools that can target the problematic overactivity of this pathway. The Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling cascade is known to be activated in several types of cancer, and regulates the transcription of proteins involved in apoptosis. In addition, studies have shown that mutations of the Raf component of the pathway can contribute to chemotherapy drug resistance.  Separate studies investigating selumetinib protein binding found that 96% of selumetinib was bound to serum albumin, while <35% was bound to ɑ-1 acid glycoprotein. Overall, approximately 98.4% of selumetinib is plasma protein bound. Selumetinib is a non-ATP-competitive mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 and 2 (MEK1 and MEK2) inhibitor. By selectively targeting MEK1 and MEK2, selumetinib is able to inhibit oncogenic downstream effects of the Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway, which is often overactive in certain types of cancer. Indeed, a study investigating the effects of selumetinib in children with NF-1 found that treatment with the anti-neoplastic resulted in reduced tumor size. Decreases in tumor-associated pain and improvements in overall function were also subjectively reported. Although selumetinib has been investigated for the treatment of several types of cancer, it is currently only indicated for the treatment of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) in patients ≥2 years who have symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PN).\"\n",
      "Rifamycin_(14451),\"Rifamycin belongs to drug node. Rifamycin is the prime member of the rifamycin family which are represented by drugs that are a product of fermentation from the gram-positive bacterium _Amycolatopsis mediterranei_, also known as _Streptomyces mediterranei_. The parent compound of rifamycin was rifamycin B which was originally obtained as a main product in the presence of diethylbarburitic acid. Some small modifications where performed in this inactive compound and with the creation of rifamycin SV there was the first antibiotic used intravenously for the treatment of tuberculosis. Rifamycins, as well as all the other members of this group, present an antibacterial mechanism of action related to the inhibition of RNA synthesis. This mechanism of action is done by the strong binding to the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase of prokaryotes. The inhibition of the RNA synthesis is thought to be related with the initiation phase of the process and to involve stacking interactions between the naphthalene ring and the aromatic moiety in the polymerase. As well, it has been suggested that the presence of zinc atoms in the polymerase allows for the binding of phenolic -OH groups of the naphthalene ring.  The protein binding of rifamycin is of about 80-95%. Rifamycin is known to be effective against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens and mycobacteria. It is very effective against _E. coli_ reporting a MIC90 of 64-128 mcg/ml without showing cross-resistance with other antimicrobial agents. Rifamycin is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with travelers' diarrhea caused by noninvasive strains of _E. coli_. The status of the disease should not be complicated by fever or blood in the stool. To prevent drug-resistant bacteria, it is important to mention that the use of rifamycin for this indication should be only done in cases where the infection is proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria.\"\n",
      "Istradefylline_(14452),\"Istradefylline belongs to drug node. Istradefylline, or KW6002, was developed by Kyowa Hakko Kirin in Japan for the treatment of Parkinson's disease as an adjunct to standard therapy. Unlike standard dopaminergic therapies for Parkinson's, Istradefylline targets adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptors in the basal ganglia. This region of the brain is highly involved in motor control. Istradefylline is a selective adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor inhibitor. These receptors are found in the basal ganglia, a region of the brain that suffers degeneration in Parkinson's disease, and is also significantly involved in motor control. A<sub>2A</sub> receptors are also expressed on GABAergic medium spiny neurons within the indirect striato-pallidal pathway. The GABAergic action of this pathway is thereby reduced. Istradefylline has 56 times the affinity for A<sub>2A</sub> receptors than A<sub>1</sub> receptors. Istradefylline is approximately 98% protein bound in plasma, mostly to serum albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Istradefylline is a selective adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor inhibitor. It has a long duration of action as it is given once daily and has a half life of 64-69 hours. Patients taking this medication should be monitored for dyskinesia, hallucinations, and lack of impulse control. Consider dose reductions for these patients. Istradefylline is indicated in adjunct to levodopa and carbidopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.\"\n",
      "Fostemsavir_(14453),\"Fostemsavir belongs to drug node. Fostemsavir is the phosphonooxymethyl prodrug of temsavir, a novel HIV-1 attachment inhibitor. It binds to and inhibits the activity of gp120, a subunit within the HIV-1 gp160 envelope glycoprotein that facilitates the attachment of HIV-1 to host cell CD4 receptors - in doing so, temsavir prevents the first step in the HIV-1 viral lifecycle. The discovery of gp120 as a potential target of interest in the treatment of HIV-1 infection is relatively recent, and was born out of a desire to find alternative target proteins (i.e. mechanistically orthogonal therapies) for the treatment of HIV-1 patients with resistant infections. Fostemavir is the first attachment inhibitor to receive FDA approval, granted in July 2020 for use in combination with other antiretrovirals in highly treatment-experienced patients with multidrug-resistant HIV-1 infection whom are failing their current therapy. Targeting gp120 subunits is a new and novel therapeutic approach to HIV-1 infection, and the addition of attachment inhibitors, like temsavir, to the armament of therapies targeted against HIV-1 fills a necessary niche for therapeutic options in patients left with few, if any, viable treatments. The gp120 subunit within the gp160 envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1 is a new and novel target in the treatment of HIV-1 infection. These subunits are responsible for facilitating the first step in the viral life cycle, attachment, by mediating the interaction between the virus and host cell CD4 receptors. Following attachment, HIV-1 undergoes assembly, budding, and maturation within the host cell, after which mature viral particles are released to continue the viral life cycle. Temsavir is approximately 88.4% protein-bound in plasma, primarily to serum albumin. Temsavir inhibits the first stage in the HIV-1 viral lifecycle: attachment. It has a moderate duration of action necessitating twice-daily dosing. Fostemsavir, administered at roughly 4x the recommended human dose, has been observed to significantly prolong the QTc-interval. Patients with a history of QTc-prolongation, those receiving other QTc-prolonging medications, and/or those with pre-existing cardiac disease should use fostemsavir with caution, and should be monitored at baseline and throughout therapy for signs or symptoms suggestive of QTc-prolongation. Fostemsavir should also be used with caution in patients with hepatitis B or C co-infection as elevations in hepatic transaminases were observed in greater proportions in these populations in clinical trials. Fostemsavir is indicated, in combination with other antiretrovirals, for the treatment of multidrug-resistant HIV-1 infection in heavily treatment-experienced adults failing their current antiretroviral therapy due to resistance, intolerance, or safety concerns.\"\n",
      "Ertugliflozin_(14455),\"Ertugliflozin belongs to drug node. Ertugliflozin belongs to the class of potent and selective inhibitors of the sodium-dependent glucose cotransporters (SGLT), more specifically the type 2 which is responsible for about 90% of the glucose reabsorption from glomerulus. This drug was developed under the collaboration of Merck and Pfizer. It was FDA approved as monotherapy and in combination with sitagliptin or metformin hydrochloride on December 22, 2017. As part of a normal process, the glucose from the blood is filtered for excretion and reabsorbed in the glomerulus so less than one percent of this glucose is excreted in the urine. The reabsorption is mediated by the sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter (SGLT), mainly the type 2 which is responsible for 90% of the reabsorbed glucose. Ertugliflozin is a small inhibitor of the SGLT2 and its activity increases glucose excretion, reducing hyperglycemia without the requirement of excessive insulin secretion. Ertugliflozin is highly bound to plasma proteins and it binds in a range of 94-96% independently of the administered concentration. Administration of ertugliflozin increases urinary glucose excretion which leads to a negative balance and osmotic diuresis. Thus, this antidiabetic agent has been reported to significantly reduce the body weight and blood pressure of diabetic patients.  Ertugliflozin as a monotherapy is indicated to improve the glycemic control in adult patients with type 2 diabetes. Ertugliflozin, in combination with metformin hydrochloride, is indicated to improve glycemic control in patients with diabetes type 2 who are not controlled on a regimen of ertugliflozin or metformin or in patients who are already treated with both ertugliflozin and metformin. The administration of ertugliflozin in combination with sitagliptin is indicated to improve glycemic control in adult patients with type 2 diabetes when treatment with ertugliflozin and sitagliptin is appropriate. It is pointed out that the use of ertugliflozin has to be an adjunct therapy to the use of diet and exercise.\"\n",

It was first approved in Japan in 2019, under the brand name Relumina, for the symptomatic treatment of uterine fibroids, and more recently by the United States' FDA in 2020, under the brand name Orgovyx, for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Relugolix has also been studied in the symptomatic treatment of endometriosis.  The pathogenesis and progression of prostate cancer appear driven, at least in part, by the effects of testosterone. Androgen deprivation has been demonstrated to result in cell death and tumor regression in many well-differentiated prostate cancer cell lines - for this reason, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has become a standard in the treatment of prostate cancer, particularly in advanced disease. Relugolix is 68-71% protein-bound in plasma, primarily to albumin and, to a lesser extent, α1-acid glycoprotein. Approximately 56% of patients achieved castrate-level testosterone concentrations (<50 ng/dL) by day 4 of therapy and 97% of patients maintain these levels through 48 weeks of therapy. Relugolix requires once-daily oral administration to maintain the desired testosterone concentrations. Relugolix is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced prostate cancer.\"\n",

The LABA group falls into a parent category known as long-acting inhaled bronchodilators and this type of agents are recommended as a maintece therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). From the LABA group, revefenacin is the first once-daily nebulized LAMA treatment. It was developed by Theravance Biopharma and FDA approved on November 9, 2018.\"\" Revefenacin is an inhaled bronchodilator muscarinic antagonist with a long-acting bronchodilation activity. It has been shown to present a high affinity and behaved as a competitive antagonist of the five muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Studies have indicated that revefenacin dissociates significantly slower from the muscarinic receptor M3 (hM3) when compared to the receptor M2 (hM2) which indicates a kinetic selectivity for this subtype. This competitive antagonism produces a suppressive action of the acetylcholine-evoked calcium mobilization and contractile responses in the airway tissue. Lastly, due to the duration of the bronchodilation, revefenacin is considered a long-acting muscarinic antagonist which allows it to be dosed once daily. The protein binding of revefenacin and its active metabolite is of 71% and 42% respectively. Revefenacin has been reported to produce a sustained, long-acting bronchodilation with lower anti-muscarinic-related side effects. In clinical trials, revefenacin demonstrated to be of a long duration of action and low systemic exposure in patients with COPD. Also, it was reported that a dose of 88 mcg can produce a clinically effective bronchodilation measured by through forced expiratory volume in 1s and serial spirometric assessments.

Abemaciclib is an antitumor agent and dual inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 (CDK4) and 6 (CDK6) that are involved in the cell cycle and promotion of cancer cell growth in case of unregulated activity. On September 28, 2017, FDA granted approval of abemaciclib treatment under the market name Verzenio for the treatment of HR-positive and HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer that has progressed after unsuccessful endocrine therapy. It is either given alone in patients who has undergone endocrine therapy and chemotherapy after the metastasis of cancer, or in combination with. Following oral treatment in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, abemaciclib demonstrated increased progression-free survival rates and objective response rates. Abemaciclib has been used in trials studying the treatment of melanoma, lymphoma, neoplasm, solid tumor, and glioblastoma. Regulation of cell cycle is crucial in maintaining proper cell growth; dysregulated cell cycle signalling pathway is a key component in inducing hyperproliferation of cells and tumor formation in various cancers. G1 to S phase cell cycle progression, or transition through the G1 restriction point (R), is promoted by the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb)-mediated pathway. Activation of Rb-mediated pathway requires the interaction of Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4 and 6 with D-type cyclins, which drives the formation of active CDK4/CDK6 and subsequent phosphorylation of Rb.  According to in vitro models using animal brain tissues, the protein binding of abemaciclib is approximately 95-98%. While abemaciclib demonstrated *in vitro* binding to serum albumin, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein and other human plasma proteins in a concentration-depedent manner, its major metabolites are also shown to bind to plasms proteins as well. The approximate bound fractions of M2, M18 and M20 are 93.4%, 96.8% and 97.8%, respectively.  In combination with fulvestrant, the progression-free survival for patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer was 16.4 months compared to 9.3 months for patients taking a placebo with fulvestrant. As a monotherapy, 19.7% of patients taking abemaciclib achieved complete or partial shrinkage of their tumors for a median 8.6 months after treatment.

Lobeglitazone was approved by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (South Korea) in 2013, and is being monitored by postmarketing surveillance until 2019. Lobeglitazone is not approved for use by either the Food and Drug Administration (USA), Health Canada, or by the European Medicines Agency for use in the management of diabetes.\"\n",
      "Osimertinib_(15377),\"Osimertinib belongs to drug node. Osimertinib is an oral, third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) drug developed by AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals. Its use is indicated for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in cases where tumour EGFR expression is positive for the T790M mutation as detected by FDA-approved testing and which has progressed following therapy with a first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Approximately 10% of patients with NSCLC have a rapid and clinically effective response to EGFR-TKIs due to the presence of specific activating EGFR mutations within the tumour cells. More specifically, deletions around the LREA motif in exon 19 and exon 21 L858R point mutations are correlated with response to therapy.  Osimertinib is an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that binds to certain mutant forms of EGFR (T790M, L858R, and exon 19 deletion) that predominate in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumours following treatment with first-line EGFR-TKIs. As a third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, osimertinib is specific for the gate-keeper T790M mutation which increases ATP binding activity to EGFR and results in poor prognosis for late-stage disease. Furthermore, osimertinib has been shown to spare wild-type EGFR during therapy, thereby reducing non-specific binding and limiting toxicity.  Plasma protein binding is likely high due to its physiochemical properties. A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis suggested a concentration-dependent QTc interval prolongation of 14 msec (upper bound of two-sided 90% CI: 16 msec) at a dose of osimertinib 80 mg. Osimertinib is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as detected by an FDA- approved test, who have progressed on or after EGFR-TKI therapy.\"\n",
      "Capmatinib_(15388),\"Capmatinib belongs to drug node. Capmatinib is a small molecule kinase inhibitor targeted against c-Met (a.k.a. hepatocyte growth factor receptor ), a receptor tyrosine kinase that, in healthy humans, activates signaling cascades involved in organ regeneration and tissue repair. Aberrant c-Met activation - via mutations, amplification, and/or overexpression - is known to occur in many types of cancer, and leads to overactivation of multiple downstream signaling pathways such as STAT3, PI3K/ATK, and RAS/MAPK. Mutations in _MET_ have been detected in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and the prevalence of _MET_ amplification in epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI)-naive patients with NSCLC has been reported to be 1.4% - 21%. This co-occurrence has made c-Met a desirable target in the treatment of NSCLC. Aberrant activation of c-Met has been documented in many cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Mutations that result in the skipping of _MET_ exon 14 lead to the formation of a mutant c-Met with a missing regulatory domain - these mutant proteins have a reduced ability to negatively regulate, leading to a pathological increase in their downstream activity. Plasma protein binding is approximately 96% and is independent of drug serum concentration. Capmatinib inhibits the overactivity of c-Met, a receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by the _MET_ proto-oncogene. Mutations in _MET_ are involved in the proliferation of many cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Capmatinib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have a mutation that leads to mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) exon 14 skipping as detected by an FDA-approved test.\"\n",

      "Voxilaprevir_(15392),\"Voxilaprevir belongs to drug node. Voxilaprevir is a Direct-Acting Antiviral (DAA) medication used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients.  Voxilaprevir exerts its antiviral action by reversibley binding and inhibiting the NS3/4A serine protease of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). Following viral replication of HCV genetic material and translation into a single polypeptide, Nonstructural Protein 3 (NS3) and its activating cofactor Nonstructural Protein 4A (NS4A) are responsible for cleaving genetic material into the following structural and nonstructural proteins required for assembly into mature virus: NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B. By inhibiting viral protease NS3/4A, voxilaprevir therefore prevents viral replication and function.  Voxilaprevir is more than 99% bound to human plasma proteins. Voxilaprevir is a direct-acting antiviral agent that targets viral NS3/4A protein and causes a decrease in serum HCV RNA levels. It disrupts HCV replication by specifically inhibiting the critical functions of NS3/4A protein in the replication complex. It does not appear to prolong the QT interval even when given at 9 times the maximum recommended dose.  Vosevi (Voxilaprevir//) is approved for use in patients with genotypes 1-6 who have been previously treated with an NS5A inhibitor, or patients with genotypes 1a or 3 infection who have previously been treated with an HCV regimen containing without an NS5A inhibitor. \"\n",
      "Histamine_(15412),\"Histamine belongs to drug node. A depressor amine derived by enzymatic decarboxylation of histidine. It is a powerful stimulant of gastric secretion, a constrictor of bronchial smooth muscle, a vasodilator, and also a centrally acting neurotransmitter. Histamine acts directly on the blood vessels to dilate arteries and capillaries; this action is mediated by both H 1- and H 2-receptors. Capillary dilatation may produce flushing of the face, a decrease in systemic blood pressure, and gastric gland secretion, causing an increased secretion of gastric juice of high acidity. Increased capillary permeability accompanies capillary dilatation, producing an outward passage of plasma protein and fluid into the extracellular spaces, an increase in lymph flow and protein content, and the formation of edema. In addition, histamine has a direct stimulant action on smooth muscle, producing contraction if H 1-receptors are activated, or mostly relaxation if H 2-receptors are activated. Also in humans, the stimulant effect of histamine may cause contraction of the intestinal muscle. However, little effect is noticed on the uterus, bladder, or gallbladder. Histamine has some stimulant effect on duodenal, salivary, pancreatic, bronchial, and lacrimal glands. Histamine also can bind to H3 and H4 receptors which are involved in the CNS/PNS neurotransmitter release and immune system chemotaxis, respectively.  Histamine stimulates gastric gland secretion, causing an increased secretion of gastric juice of high acidity. This action is probably due mainly to a direct action on parietal and chief gland cells. Histamine phosphate is indicated as a diagnostic aid for the evaluation of gastric acid secretory function.\"\n",
      "Gemcitabine_(15413),\"Gemcitabine belongs to drug node. Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analog used as chemotherapy. It is marketed as Gemzar® by Eli Lilly and Company. As with fluorouracil and other analogues of pyrimidines, the drug replaces one of the building blocks of nucleic acids, in this case cytidine, during DNA replication. The process arrests tumor growth, as new nucleosides cannot be attached to the \\faulty\\\"\" nucleoside, resulting in apoptosis (cellular \\\"\"suicide\\\"\").\"\" Gemcitabine inhibits thymidylate synthetase, leading to inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell death. Gemcitabine is a prodrug so activity occurs as a result of intracellular conversion to two active metabolites, gemcitabine diphosphate and gemcitabine triphosphate by deoxycitidine kinase. Gemcitabine diphosphate also inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, the enzyme responsible for catalyzing synthesis of deoxynucleoside triphosphates required for DNA synthesis. Finally, Gemcitabine triphosphate (diflurorodeoxycytidine triphosphate) competes with endogenous deoxynucleoside triphosphates for incorporation into DNA. Plasma protein binding is negligible (<10%) Gemcitabine is an antineoplastic anti-metabolite. Anti-metabolites masquerade as purine or pyrimidine - which become the building blocks of DNA. They prevent these substances becoming incorporated in to DNA during the \\S\\\"\" phase (or DNA synthesis phase of the cell cycle), stopping normal development and division. Gemcitabine blocks an enzyme which converts the cytosine nucleotide into the deoxy derivative. In addition, DNA synthesis is further inhibited because Gemcitabine blocks the incorporation of the thymidine nucleotide into the DNA strand. It demonstrates dose-dependent synergistic activity with cisplatin in vitro. In vivo, gemcitabine showed activity in combination with cisplatin against the LX-1 and CALU-6 human lung xenografts, but minimal activity was seen with the NCI-H460 or NCI-H520 xenografts. Gemcitabine was synergistic with cisplatin in the Lewis lung murine xenograft. Sequential exposure to gemcitabine 4 hours before cisplatin produced the greatest interaction.\"\" Gemcitabine is indicated for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer that has relapsed at least 6 months after completion of platinum-based therapy; metastatic ovarian cancer; inoperable, locally advanced (Stage IIIA or IIIB), or metastatic (Stage IV) non-small cell lung cancer; and locally advanced (nonresectable Stage II or Stage III) or metastatic (Stage IV) adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. \"\n",
      "Azithromycin_(15419),\"Azithromycin belongs to drug node. Azithromycin is a broad-spectrum macrolide antibiotic with a long half-life and a high degree of tissue penetration. It was initially approved by the FDA in 1991. In order to replicate, bacteria require a specific process of protein synthesis, enabled by ribosomal proteins. Azithromycin binds to the 23S rRNA of the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit. It stops bacterial protein synthesis by inhibiting the transpeptidation/translocation step of protein synthesis and by inhibiting the assembly of the 50S ribosomal subunit ,. This results in the control of various bacterial infections ,.  The strong affinity of macrolides, including azithromycin, for bacterial ribosomes, is consistent with their broad‐spectrum antibacterial activities. The serum protein binding of azithromycin varies in humans, decreasing from 51% at 0.02 g/mL to 7% at 2 g/mL. Macrolides stop bacterial growth by inhibiting protein synthesis and translation, treating bacterial infections. Azithromycin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria in order to prevent the development antimicrobial resistance and maintain the efficacy of azithromycin.\"\n",
      "Pantoprazole_(15420),\"Pantoprazole belongs to drug node. Pantoprazole is a first-generation proton pump inhibitor (PPI) used for the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), for gastric protection to prevent recurrence of stomach ulcers or gastric damage from chronic use of NSAIDs, and for the treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions including Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) Syndrome. It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including , , and , for example. Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including , , , , and. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) secretion into the gastric lumen is a process regulated mainly by the H(+)/K(+)-ATPase of the proton pump, expressed in high quantities by the parietal cells of the stomach. ATPase is an enzyme on the parietal cell membrane that facilitates hydrogen and potassium exchange through the cell, which normally results in the extrusion of potassium and formation of HCl (gastric acid).  Approximately 98% This drug acts to decrease gastric acid secretion, which reduces stomach acidity. Pantoprazole administration leads to long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. \"\n",
      "Cabergoline_(15424),\"Cabergoline belongs to drug node. Cabergoline, an ergot derivative, is a long-acting dopamine agonist and prolactin inhibitor. It is used to treat hyperprolactinemic disorders and Parkinsonian Syndrome. Cabergoline possesses potent agonist activity on dopamine D2 receptors. The dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor is a 7-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor associated with G<sub>i</sub> proteins. In lactotrophs, stimulation of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> causes inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, which decreases intracellular cAMP concentrations and blocks IP3-dependent release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores. Decreases in intracellular calcium levels may also be brought about via inhibition of calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels, rather than via inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Additionally, receptor activation blocks phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK and decreases MAPK/ERK kinase phosphorylation. Inhibition of MAPK appears to be mediated by c-Raf and B-Raf-dependent inhibition of MAPK/ERK kinase. Dopamine-stimulated growth hormone release from the pituitary gland is mediated by a decrease in intracellular calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels rather than via adenylyl cyclase inhibition. Stimulation of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway leads to improvements in coordinated muscle activity in those with movement disorders. Cabergoline is a long-acting dopamine receptor agonist with a high affinity for D2 receptors. Receptor-binding studies indicate that cabergoline has low affinity for dopamine D1, &alpha;<sub>1</sub>,- and &alpha;<sub>2</sub>- adrenergic, and 5-HT<sub>1</sub>- and 5-HT<sub>2</sub>-serotonin receptors. Moderately bound (40% to 42%) to human plasma proteins in a concentration-independent manner. Cabergoline stimulates centrally-located dopaminergic receptors resulting in a number of pharmacologic effects. Five dopamine receptor types from two dopaminergic subfamilies have been identified. The dopaminergic D1 receptor subfamily consists of D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>5</sub> subreceptors, which are associated with dyskinesias. The dopaminergic D2 receptor subfamily consists of D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub> and D<sub>4</sub> subreceptors, which are associated with improvement of symptoms of movement disorders. Thus, agonist activity specific for D2 subfamily receptors, primarily D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> receptor subtypes, are the primary targets of dopaminergic antiparkinsonian agents. It is thought that postsynaptic D2 stimulation is primarily responsible for the antiparkinsonian effect of dopamine agonists, while presynaptic D2 stimulation confers neuroprotective effects. This semisynthetic ergot derivative exhibits potent agonist activity on dopamine D<sub>2</sub>- and D<sub>3</sub>-receptors. It also exhibits: agonist activity (in order of decreasing binding affinities) on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)<sub>2B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>, dopamine D<sub>4</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, dopamine D<sub>1</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors and antagonist activity on &alpha;<sub>2B</sub>, &alpha;<sub>2A</sub>, and &alpha;<sub>2C</sub> receptors. Parkinsonian Syndrome manifests when approximately 80% of dopaminergic activity in the nigrostriatal pathway of the brain is lost. As this striatum is involved in modulating the intensity of coordinated muscle activity (e.g. movement, balance, walking), loss of activity may result in dystonia (acute muscle contraction), Parkinsonism (including symptoms of bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and flattened affect), akathesia (inner restlessness), tardive dyskinesia (involuntary muscle movements usually associated with long-term loss of dopaminergic activity), and neuroleptic maligt syndrome, which manifests when complete blockage of nigrostriatal dopamine occurs. High dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain causes hallucinations and delusions; these side effects of dopamine agonists are manifestations seen in patients with schizophrenia who have overractivity in this area of the brain. The hallucinogenic side effects of dopamine agonists may also be due to 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> agonism. The tuberoinfundibular pathway of the brain originates in the hypothalamus and terminates in the pituitary gland. In this pathway, dopamine inhibits lactotrophs in anterior pituitary from secreting prolactin. Increased dopaminergic activity in the tuberoinfundibular pathway inhibits prolactin secretion.  For the treatment of hyperprolactinemic disorders, either idiopathic or due to prolactinoma (prolactin-secreting adenomas). May also be used to manage symptoms of Parkinsonian Syndrome as monotherapy during initial symptomatic management or as an adjunct to levodopa therapy during advanced stages of disease. \"\n",
      "Dihydroergotamine_(15431),\"Dihydroergotamine belongs to drug node. A 9,10alpha-dihydro derivative of ergotamine. It is used as a vasoconstrictor, specifically for the therapy of migraine disorders. Two theories have been proposed to explain the efficacy of 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptor agonists in migraine: 1) activation of 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors located on intracranial blood vessels, including those on arterio-venous anastomoses, leads to vasoconstriction, which correlates with the relief of migraine headache and 2) activation of 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors on sensory nerve endings of the trigeminal system results in the inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. 93% (to plasma proteins) Dihydroergotamine is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine headaches with or without aura and the acute treatment of cluster headache episodes. Dihydroergotamine binds with high affinity to 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>a and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>b receptors. It also binds with high affinity to serotonin 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors, noradrenaline a2A, a2B and a receptors, and dopamine D2L and D3 receptors. The therapeutic activity of Dihydroergotamine in migraine is generally attributed to the agonist effect at 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors. For the acute treatment of migraine headaches with or without aura and the acute treatment of cluster headache episodes.\"\n",
      "Megestrol acetate_(15435),\"Megestrol acetate belongs to drug node. 17-Hydroxy-6-methylpregna-3,6-diene-3,20-dione. A progestational hormone used most commonly as the acetate ester. As the acetate, it is more potent than progesterone both as a progestagen and as an ovulation inhibitor. It has also been used in the palliative treatment of breast cancer. The precise mechanism by which megestrol acetate produces effects in anorexia and cachexia is unknown at the present time, but its progestin antitumour activity may involve suppression of luteinizing hormone by inhibition of pituitary function. Studies also suggest that the megestrol's weight gain effect is related to its appetite-stimulant or metabolic effects rather than its glucocorticoid-like effects or the production of edema. It has also been suggested that megestrol may alter metabolic pathyways via interferences with the production or action of mediators such as cachectin, a hormone that inhibits adipocyte lipogenic enzymes.   Megestrol is a synthetic progestin and has the same physiologic effects as natural progesterone. These effects include induction of secretory changes in the endometrium, increase in basal body temperature, pituitary inhibition, and production of withdrawal bleeding in the presence of estrogen. Mestrogel has slight glucocorticoid activity and very slight mineralocorticoid activity. This drug has no estrogenic, androgenic, or anabolic activity. The precise mechanism of megestrol&rsquo;s antianorexic and anticachetic effects is unknown. Initially developed as a contraceptive, it was first evaluated in breast cancer treatment in 1967. For the treatment of anorexia, cachexia, or an unexplained, significant weight loss in patients with a diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Also used for the palliative management of recurrent, inoperable, or metastatic breast cancer, endometrial cancer, and prostate cancer in Canada and some other countries.\"\n",
      "Caspofungin_(15443),\"Caspofungin belongs to drug node. Caspofungin (brand name Cancidas worldwide) is an antifungal drug and the first member of a new drug class called the echinocandins, as coined by Merck & Co., Inc. It is typically administered intravenously. It shows activity against infections with Aspergillus and Candida, and works by inhibiting β(1,3)-D-Glucan of the fungal cell wall. Caspofungin inhibits the synthesis of beta-(1,3)-D-glucan, an essential component of the cell wall of <i>Aspergillus</i> species and <i>Candida</i> species. beta-(1,3)-D-glucan is not present in mammalian cells. The primary target is beta-(1,3)-glucan synthase. 97% Caspofungin is an antifungal drug, and belongs to a new class termed the echinocandins. It is used to treat <i>Aspergillus</i> and <i>Candida</i> infection, and works by inhibiting cell wall synthesis. Antifungals in the echinocandin class inhibit the synthesis of glucan in the cell wall, probably via the enzyme 1,3-beta glucan synthase. There is a potential for resistance development to occur, however <i>in vitro</i> resistance development to Caspofungin by Aspergillus species has not been studied.

      "Toremifene_(15444),\"Toremifene belongs to drug node. A first generation nonsteroidal selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that is structurally related to tamoxifen. Like tamoxifen, it is an estrogen agonist for bone tissue and cholesterol metabolism but is antagonistic on mammary and uterine tissue. Toremifene is a nonsteroidal triphenylethylene derivative. Toremifene binds to estrogen receptors and may exert estrogenic, antiestrogenic, or both activities, depending upon the duration of treatment, animal species, gender, target organ, or endpoint selected. The antitumor effect of toremifene in breast cancer is believed to be mainly due to its antiestrogenic effects, in other words, its ability to compete with estrogen for binding sites in the cancer, blocking the growth-stimulating effects of estrogen in the tumor. Toremifene may also inhibit tumor growth through other mechanisms, such as induction of apoptosis, regulation of oncogene expression, and growth factors. Toremifen is primarily bound to albumin (92%), 2% bound to α1-acid glycoprotein, and 6% bound to β1-globulin in the serum. Toremifene is an antineoplastic hormonal agent primarily used in the treatment of advanced breast cancer. Toremifene is a nonsteroidal agent that has demonstrated potent antiestrogenic properties in animal test systems. The antiestrogenic effects may be related to its ability to compete with estrogen for binding sites in target tissues such as breast. Toremifene inhibits the induction of rat mammary carcinoma induced by dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA) and causes the regression of already established DMBA-induced tumors. In this rat model, Toremifene appears to exert its antitumor effects by binding the estrogen receptors. In cytosols derived from human breast adenocarcinomas, Toremifene competes with estradiol for estrogen receptor protein. For the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive or receptor-unknown tumors. Toremifene is currently under investigation as a preventative agent for prostate cancer in men with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and no evidence of prostate cancer.\"\n",
      "Ivermectin_(15450),\"Ivermectin belongs to drug node. Ivermectin is a broad-spectrum anti-parasite medication. It was first marketed under the name Stromectol® and used against worms (except tapeworms), but, in 2012, it was approved for the topical treatment of head lice infestations in patients 6 months of age and older, and marketed under the name Sklice™ as well. Ivermectin is mainly used in humans in the treatment of onchocerciasis, but is also effective against other worm infestations (such as strongyloidiasis, ascariasis, trichuriasis and enterobiasis). Ivermectin binds selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels in invertebrate muscle and nerve cells of the microfilaria. This binding causes an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions and results in hyperpolarization of the cell, leading to paralysis and death of the parasite. Ivermectin also is believed to act as an agonist of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), thereby disrupting GABA-mediated central nervous system (CNS) neurosynaptic transmission. Ivermectin may also impair normal intrauterine development of O. volvulus microfilariae and may inhibit their release from the uteri of gravid female worms. 93% Ivermectin is a semisynthetic, anthelminitic agent. It is an avermectin which a group of pentacyclic sixteen-membered lactone (i.e. a macrocyclic lactone disaccharide) derived from the soil bacterium Streptomyces avermitilis. Avermectins are potent anti-parasitic agents. Ivermectin is the most common avermectin. It is a broad spectrum antiparasitic drug for oral administration. It is sometimes used to treat human onchocerciasis (river blindness). It is the mixture of 22,23-dihydro-avermectin B1a (at least 90%) and 22,23-dihydro-avermectin B1b (less than 10%). For the treatment of intestinal (i.e., nondisseminated) strongyloidiasis due to the nematode parasite <i>Strongyloides stercoralis</i>.

      "Bisoprolol_(15451),\"Bisoprolol belongs to drug node. Bisoprolol is a cardioselective β1-adrenergic blocking agent used to treat high blood pressure. It is considered a potent drug with a long-half life that can be used once daily to reduce the need for multiple doses of antihypertensive drugs. Bisoprolol is generally well tolerated, likely due to its β1-adrenergic receptor selectivity and is a useful alternative to non-selective β-blocker drugs in the treatment of hypertension such as and. It may be used alone or in combination with other drugs to manage hypertension and can be useful in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to its receptor selectivity. Though the mechanism of action of bisoprolol has not been fully elucidated in hypertension, it is thought that therapeutic effects are achieved through the antagonism of β-1adrenoceptors to result in lower cardiac output. Bisoprolol is a competitive, cardioselective β1-adrenergic antagonist. When β1-receptors (located mainly in the heart) are activated by adrenergic neurotransmitters such as epinephrine, both the blood pressure and heart rate increase, leading to greater cardiovascular work, increasing the demand for oxygen. Bisoprolol reduces cardiac workload by decreasing contractility and the need for oxygen through competitive inhibition of β1-adrenergic receptors. Binding to serum proteins is approximately 30%. Bisoprolol decreases heart rate (chronotropy), decreases contractility (inotropy), and reduces blood pressure. The results of various clinical studies indicate that bisoprolol reduces cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure and decreased cardiac ejection fraction (EF).  Bisoprolol is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. It may be used off-label to treat heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and angina pectoris.\"\n",
      "Tegaserod_(15141),\"Tegaserod belongs to drug node. Novartis' brand name Zelnorm (tegaserod) had originally received approval from the US FDA in 2002 for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C). It was, however, voluntarily withdrawn from widespread use in the US market in 2007 after concerns arose over the possibility that tegaserod could potentially cause dangerous cardiovascular events in patients. Since then, closer evaluations of the original data suggesting such cardiovascular risk have resulted in the limited reintroduction or 're-approval' of tegaserod for treatment of IBS-C specifically in female patients less than 65 years of age and whom are considered to be at a lower risk of a cardiovascular event than the broader population. Zelnorm (tegaserod) by Sloan Pharma subsequently gained re-approval in April of 2019. Nevertheless, tegaserod remains un-approved in certain regions. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a complex functional disorder comprised of various abnormal and discomforting effects on the gastrointestinal tract and bowel function. Although the cause of IBS has yet to be formally elucidated, patient experience has demonstrated that the disorder is typically associated with abdominal pain, abdominal distension, cramping or bloating, variations in urgency for bowel movements, feelings of incomplete evacuation, gastroesophageal reflux, and various other effects. In particular, IBS that features constipation as a predomit effect is categorized as constipation-predomit IBS, or IBS-C. The protein binding recorded for tegaserod is about 98%. In general, it has been determined that tegaserod is an agonist of serotonin type-4 (5-HT(4)) receptors, an antagonist at 5-HT(2B) receptors, but is expected to possess minimal binding to 5-HT(1) receptors, and virtually no affinity for 5-HT(3) or dopamine receptors. Tegaserod is a serotonin-4 (5-HT4) receptor agonist indicated for the treatment of adult women less than 65 years of age with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C). The safety and effectiveness of tegaserod in men with IBS-C have not been established.\"\n",
      "Bicalutamide_(15143),\"Bicalutamide belongs to drug node. Bicalutamide is an oral non-steroidal anti-androgen for prostate cancer. It is comprised of a racemic mixture that is a 50:50 composition of the (R)-bicalutamide and (S)-bicalutamide etionmers. Bicalutamide binds to the androgen receptor. Bicalutamide competes with androgen for the binding of androgen receptors, consequently blocking the action of androgens of adrenal and testicular origin which stimulate the growth of normal and maligt prostatic tissue. 96% Bicalutamide is an antineoplastic hormonal agent primarily used in the treatment of prostate cancer. Bicalutamide is a pure, nonsteroidal anti-androgen with affinity for androgen receptors (but not for progestogen, estrogen, or glucocorticoid receptors). Consequently, Bicalutamide blocks the action of androgens of adrenal and testicular origin which stimulate the growth of normal and maligt prostatic tissue. Prostate cancer is mostly androgen-dependent and can be treated with surgical or chemical castration. To date, antiandrogen monotherapy has not consistently been shown to be equivalent to castration.

      "Nefazodone_(15146),\"Nefazodone belongs to drug node. Nefazodone hydrochloride (trade name Serzone) is an antidepressant drug marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb. Its sale was discontinued in 2003 in some countries, due to the small possibility of hepatic (liver) injury. Drug-induced hepatic injuries were associated with an risk of elevated need for a liver transplant, or even death, with the incidence of severe liver damage was shown to be approximately 1 in 250,000 to 300,000 patient-years. On May 20, 2004, Bristol-Myers Squibb discontinued the sale of Serzone in the United States. Within the serotonergic system, nefazodone acts as an antagonist at type 2 serotonin (5-HT<sub>2</sub>) post-synaptic receptors and, like fluoxetine-type antidepressants, inhibits pre-synaptic serotonin (5-HT) reuptake. These mechanisms increase the amount of serotonin available to interact with 5-HT receptors. Within the noradrenergic system, nefazodone inhibits norepinephrine uptake minimally. Nefazodone also antagonizes alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors, producing sedation, muscle relaxation, and a variety of cardiovascular effects. Nefazodone's affinity for benzodiazepine, cholinergic, dopaminergic, histaminic, and beta or alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors is not significant. Greater than 99% (in vitro, human plasma proteins). Nefazodone, an antidepressant synthetically derived phenylpiperazine, is used to treat major depression. Although it is structurally similar to trazodone, nefazodone has a mechanism of action different from other antidepressants and, hence, lacks the risk for major cardiovascular toxicity seen with tricyclics and insomnia and inhibition of REM sleep seen with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. For the treatment of depression.\"\n",
      "Escitalopram_(15148),\"Escitalopram belongs to drug node. Escitalopram is a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) and the S-etiomer of racemic. It is used to restore serotonergic function in the treatment of depression and anxiety. Escitalopram is approximately 150 times more potent than citalopram’s R-etiomer and is responsible for the vast majority of citalopram’s clinical activity, with some evidence suggesting that the R-etiomer of racemic citalopram actively dampens the activity of escitalopram rather than existing simply as an inactive etiomer. Amongst SSRIs, escitalopram exerts the highest degree of selectivity for the serotonin transporter (SERT) relative to other off-targets which may explain its lower rates of adverse effects as compared to other agents in this class. Escitalopram also differentiates itself from other SSRIs via allosteric action on its target - this may be the mechanism responsible for its observed superior efficacy and faster onset compared to other SSRIs. Escitalopram, like other selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, enhances serotonergic activity by binding to the orthosteric (i.e. primary) binding site on the serotonin transporter (SERT), the same site to which endogenous 5-HT binds, and thus prevents the re-uptake of serotonin into the presynaptic neuron. Escitalopram, along with , is also considered an allosteric serotonin re-uptake inhibitor - it binds to a secondary allosteric site on the SERT molecule to more strongly inhibit 5-HT re-uptake. Its combination of orthosteric and allosteric activity on SERT allows for greater extracellular 5-HT levels, a faster onset of action, and greater efficacy as compared to other SSRIs. The sustained elevation of synaptic 5-HT eventually causes desensitization of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> auto-receptors, which normally shut down endogenous 5-HT release in the presence of excess 5-HT - this desensitization may be necessary for the full clinical effect of SSRIs and may be responsible for their typically prolonged onset of action. Escitalopram exhibits relatively low protein binding at approximately 55-56%. Escitalopram belongs to a class of medications called selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These agents cause an increase in serotonin levels in neuronal synapses by preventing the re-uptake of serotonin (5-HT) into the presynaptic terminals of serotonergic neurons. As compared to other SSRIs, it appears to have a relatively quick onset of effect due to its potency. Escitalopram is indicated for both acute and maintece treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) and for the acute treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). It is additionally indicated for symptomatic relief of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in Canada.\"\n",
      "Propafenone_(15150),\"Propafenone belongs to drug node. An antiarrhythmia agent that is particularly effective in ventricular arrhythmias. It also has weak beta-blocking activity. The drug is generally well tolerated. The electrophysiological effect of propafenone manifests itself in a reduction of upstroke velocity (Phase 0) of the monophasic action potential. In Purkinje fibers, and to a lesser extent myocardial fibers, propafenone reduces the fast inward current carried by sodium ions, which is responsible for the drugs antiarrhythmic actions. Diastolic excitability threshold is increased and effective refractory period prolonged. Propafenone reduces spontaneous automaticity and depresses triggered activity. At very high concentrations in vitro, propafenone can inhibit the slow inward current carried by calcium but this calcium antagonist effect probably does not contribute to antiarrhythmic efficacy. 97% Propafenone is a Class 1C antiarrhythmic drug with local anesthetic effects, and a direct stabilizing action on myocardial membranes. It is used in the treatment of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. It acts by inhibiting sodium channels to restrict the entry of sodium into cardiac cells resulting in reduced excitation. Propafenone has local anesthetic activity approximately equal to procaine. Used to prolong the time to recurrence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter (PAF) associated with disabling symptoms in patients without structural heart disease. Also used for the treatment of life-threatening documented ventricular arrhythmias, such as sustained ventricular tachycardia.\"\n",
      "Acebutolol_(15153),\"Acebutolol belongs to drug node. A cardioselective beta-adrenergic antagonist with little effect on the bronchial receptors. The drug has stabilizing and quinidine-like effects on cardiac rhythm as well as weak inherent sympathomimetic action. Acebutolol is a selective &beta;1-receptor antagonist. Activation of &beta;1-receptors by epinephrine increases the heart rate and the blood pressure, and the heart consumes more oxygen. Acebutolol blocks these receptors, lowering the heart rate and blood pressure. This drug then has the reverse effect of epinephrine. In addition, beta blockers prevent the release of renin, which is a hormone produced by the kidneys which leads to constriction of blood vessels. 26% Acebutolol is a cardioselective, beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agent, which possesses mild intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) in its therapeutically effective dose range. In general, beta-blockers reduce the work the heart has to do and allow it to beat more regularly. Acebutolol has less antagonistic effects on peripheral vascular &szlig;2-receptors at rest and after epinephrine stimulation than nonselective beta-antagonists. Low doses of acebutolol produce less evidence of bronchoconstriction than nonselective agents like propranolol but more than atenolol. For the management of hypertension and ventricular premature beats in adults.\"\n",
      "Bepridil_(15158),\"Bepridil belongs to drug node. A long-acting, non selective, calcium channel blocker with significant anti-anginal activity. The drug produces significant coronary vasodilation and modest peripheral effects. It has antihypertensive and selective anti-arrhythmia activities and acts as a calmodulin antagonist. It is no longer marketed in the United States, as it has been implicated in causing ventricular arrhythmias (ie. Torsade de pointes). Bepridil has inhibitory effects on both the slow calcium (L-type) and fast sodium inward currents in myocardial and vascular smooth muscle, interferes with calcium binding to calmodulin, and blocks both voltage and receptor operated calcium channels. Bepridil inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac and vascular smooth muscle. This has been demonstrated in isolated myocardial and vascular smooth muscle preparations in which both the slope of the calcium dose response curve and the maximum calcium-induced inotropic response were significantly reduced by bepridil. In cardiac myocytes <i>in vitro</i>, bepridil was shown to be tightly bound to actin. Bepridil regularly reduces heart rate and arterial pressure at rest and at a given level of exercise by dilating peripheral arterioles and reducing total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the heart works. 99% Bepridil is a calcium channel blocker that has well characterized anti-anginal properties and known but poorly characterized type 1 anti-arrhythmic and anti-hypertensive properties. It is not related chemically to other calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem hydrochloride, nifedipine and verapamil hydrochloride.

Tiotropium is a long-acting, antimuscarinic bronchodilator used in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Tiotropium acts mainly on M3 muscarinic receptors located in the airways to produce smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation. Tiotropium is an antagonist of muscarinic receptors M<sub>1</sub> to M<sub>5</sub>. Inhibition of the M<sub>3</sub> receptor in the smooth muscle of the lungs leads to relaxation of smooth muscle and bronchodilation. Tiotropium is 72% protein bound in plasma. Tiotropium is a long acting antimuscarinic that causes bronchodilation. The effects of tiotropium last over 24 hours and there is a wide therapeutic index as overdoses are uncommon even at doses well above the recommended maximum.

      "Metamfetamine_(15174),\"Metamfetamine belongs to drug node. Metamfetamine (methamphetamine) is a psychostimulant and sympathomimetic drug. It is a member of the amphetamine group of sympathomimetic amines. Methamphetamine can induce effects such as euphoria, increased alertness and energy, and enhanced self-esteem. It is a scheduled drug in most countries due to its high potential for addiction and abuse. Methamphetamine enters the brain and triggers a cascading release of norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin. To a lesser extent methamphetamine acts as a dopaminergic and adrenergic reuptake inhibitor and in high concentrations as a monamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). The mechanism of action involved in producing the beneficial behavioral changes seen in hyperkinetic children receiving methamphetamine is unknown.  Methamphetamine is a potent central nervous system stimulant which affects neurochemical mechanisms responsible for regulating heart rate, body temperature, blood pressure, appetite, attention, mood and responses associated with alertness or alarm conditions. The acute effects of the drug closely resemble the physiological and psychological effects of an epinephrine-provoked fight-or-flight response, including increased heart rate and blood pressure, vasoconstriction (constriction of the arterial walls), bronchodilation, and hyperglycemia (increased blood sugar). Users experience an increase in focus, increased mental alertness, and the elimination of fatigue, as well as a decrease in appetite.

      "Everolimus_(15176),\"Everolimus belongs to drug node. Everolimus is a derivative of Rapamycin (sirolimus), and works similarly to Rapamycin as an mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor. It is currently used as an immunosuppressant to prevent rejection of organ transplants. In a similar fashion to other mTOR inhibitors Everolimus' effect is solely on the mTORC1 protein and not on the mTORC2 protein. Everolimus is a mTOR inhibitor that binds with high affinity to the FK506 binding protein-12 (FKBP-12), thereby forming a drug complex that inhibits the activation of mTOR. This inhibition reduces the activity of effectors downstream, which leads to a blockage in the progression of cells from G1 into S phase, and subsequently inducing cell growth arrest and apoptosis. Everolimus also inhibits the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor, leading to a decrease in the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor. The result of everolimus inhibition of mTOR is a reduction in cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and glucose uptake. ~ 74% in both healthy patients and those with moderate hepatic impairment.   Everolimus is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer (advanced HR+ BC) in combination with exemestane, after failure of treatment with letrozole or anastrozole.\"\n",
      "Debrisoquine_(15183),\"Debrisoquine belongs to drug node. An adrenergic neuron-blocking drug similar in effects to guanethidine. It is also noteworthy in being a substrate for a polymorphic cytochrome P-450 enzyme. Persons with certain isoforms of this enzyme are unable to properly metabolize this and many other clinically important drugs. They are commonly referred to as having a debrisoquin 4-hydroxylase polymorphism. Debrisoquin acts at the sympathetic neuroeffector junction by inhibiting or interfering with the release and/or distribution of norepinephrine, rather than acting at the effector cell by inhibiting the association of norepinephrine with its receptors. It is taken up by norepinephrine transporters. It becomes concentrated in NE transmitter vesicles, replacing NE in these vesicles. This leads to a gradual depletion of NE stores in the nerve endings. Once inside the terminal it blocks the release of noradrenaline in response to arrival of an action potential. In contrast to ganglionic blocking agents, debrisoquin suppresses equally the responses mediated by alpha-and beta-adrenergic receptors but does not produce parasympathetic blockade. Since sympathetic blockade results in modest decreases in peripheral resistance and cardiac output, debrisoquin lowers blood pressure in the supine position. It further reduces blood pressure by decreasing the degree of vasoconstriction that normally results from reflex sympathetic nervous activity upon assumption of the upright posture, thus reducing venous return and cardiac output more.  Debrisoquin is an adrenergic neuron-blocking drug similar in effects to guanethidine. It is a substrate for a polymorphic cytochrome P-450 enzyme.

      "Nilotinib_(15187),\"Nilotinib belongs to drug node. Nilotinib, also known as AMN107, is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor under investigation as a possible treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). A Phase I clinical trial in 2006 showed that this drug was relatively safe and offered significant therapeutic benefits in cases of CML which were found to be resistant to treatment with imatinib (Gleevec), another tyrosine kinase inhibitor used as a first-line treatment for CML. Chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) is caused by the BCR-ABL oncogene. Nilotinib inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the BCR-ABL protein. Nilotinib fits into the ATP-binding site of the BCR-ABL protein with higher affinity than imatinib, over-riding resistance caused by mutations. The ability of AMN107 to inhibit TEL-platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (TEL-PDGFRbeta), which causes chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, and FIP1-like-1-PDGFRalpha, which causes hypereosinophilic syndrome, suggests potential use of AMN107 for myeloproliferative diseases characterised by these kinase fusions (Stover et al, 2005; Weisberg et al, 2005). AMN107 also inhibits the c-Kit receptor kinase, including the D816V-mutated variant of KIT, at pharmacologically achievable concentrations, supporting potential utility in the treatment of mastocytosis, and gastrointestinal stromal tumours (Weisberg et al, 2005; von Bubnoff et al, 2005; Gleixner et al, 2006).

      "Tesmilifene_(15190),\"Tesmilifene belongs to drug node. Tesmilifene is a novel potentiator of chemotherapy which, when added to doxorubicin, achieved an unexpected and very large survival advantage over doxorubicin alone in a randomized trial in advanced breast cancer. Although the exact mechanism of action is not known, one study (PMID: 16413681) proposes that tesmilifene may be an activating p-gp substrate, which enables the p-gp pump to extrude typical p-gp substrates (such as anthracyclines or taxanes) more efficiently. This process consumes ATP, since the p-gp is absolutely, and highly dependent on ATP hydrolysis. The mechanism of cell death is likely to result not from the presence of chemotherapy inside the cell (in fact the chemotherapy is extruded) but, directly or indirectly, from the enhanced consumption of ATP. The ATP may be consumed below a threshold necessary for survival, or, (more likely) the enhanced ATP production required to maintain ATP levels may result in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to an extent that overwhelms the cell’s ability to inactivate them. The result would be additional cell death, but only in the mdr+ population. The doxorubicin would continue to act on the drug sensitive remainder of the cell population, but without the help of tesmilifene.   Intended for the treatment of various forms of cancer.\"\n",

The approval was accelerated based on progression-free survival, therefore confirmatory trials by the sponsor to demonstrate clinical efficacy in multiple myeloma treatment are in progress of being conducted. Panobinostat is marketed by Novartis under the brand name Farydak. Panobinostat acts as a non-selective histone deacetylase inhibitor (pan-HDAC inhibitor) and it is the most potent DAC inhibiting agent available on the market. Panobinostat is a deacetylase (DAC) inhibitor. DACs, also known as histone DACs (HDAC), are responsible for regulating the acetylation of about 1750 proteins in the body; their functions are involved in many biological processes including DNA replication and repair, chromatin remodelling, transcription of genes, progression of the cell-cycle, protein degradation and cytoskeletal reorganization. In multiple myeloma, there is an overexpression of DAC proteins. Panobinostat inhibits class I (HDACs 1, 2, 3, 8), class II (HDACs 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10) and class IV (HDAC 11) proteins. Panobinostat's antitumor activity is believed to be attributed to epigenetic modulation of gene expression and inhibition of protein metabolism.

      "Furosemide_(14217),\"Furosemide belongs to drug node. Furosemide is a potent loop diuretic that acts on the kidneys to ultimately increase water loss from the body. It is an anthranilic acid derivative. Furosemide is used for edema secondary to various clinical conditions, such as congestive heart failure exacerbation, liver failure, renal failure, and high blood pressure. It mainly works by inhibiting electrolyte reabsorption from the kidneys and enhancing the excretion of water from the body. Furosemide has a fast onset and short duration of action and has been used safely and effectively in both pediatric and adult patients. The use of furosemide is particularly beneficial in clinical settings that require a drug with a higher diuretic potential. In addition to oral formulations, the solution for intravenous and intramuscular administration is also available, which is typically limited to patients who are unable to take oral medication or for patients in emergency clinical situations. Furosemide promotes diuresis by blocking tubular reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the proximal and distal tubules, as well as in the thick ascending loop of Henle. This diuretic effect is achieved through the competitive inhibition of sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporters (NKCC2) expressed along these tubules in the nephron, preventing the transport of sodium ions from the lumenal side into the basolateral side for reabsorption. This inhibition results in increased excretion of water along with sodium, chloride, magnesium, calcium, hydrogen, and potassium ions. As with other loop diuretics, furosemide decreases the excretion of uric acid.  Plasma concentrations ranging from 1 to 400 mcg/mL are about 91-99% bound in healthy individuals. The unbound fraction is about 2.3-4.1% at therapeutic concentrations. Furosemide mainly binds to serum albumin. Furosemide manages hypertension and edema associated with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, and renal disease, including the nephrotic syndrome. Furosemide is a potent loop diuretic that works to increase the excretion of Na+ and water by the kidneys by inhibiting their reabsorption from the proximal and distal tubules, as well as the loop of Henle. It works directly acts on the cells of the nephron and indirectly modifies the content of the renal filtrate. Ultimately, furosemide increases the urine output by the kidney. Protein-bound furosemide is delivered to its site of action in the kidneys and secreted via active secretion by nonspecific organic transporters expressed at the luminal site of action.  Furosemide is indicated for the treatment of edema associated with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and renal disease, including the nephrotic syndrome, in adults and pediatric patients. \"\n",

      "Norethisterone_(14221),\"Norethisterone belongs to drug node. Norethisterone, also known as norethindrone, is a synthetic progestational hormone belonging to the 19-nortestosterone-derived class of progestins. It is further classified as a second-generation progestin, along with and its derivatives, and is the active form of several other progestins including and. Norethisterone mimics the actions of endogenous , albeit with a greater potency, and is used on its own or in combination with estrogen derivatives in a variety of applications including contraception and hormone replacement therapy. First derived in 1951 in Mexico City, norethisterone was originally intended for use as a remedy for irregular menstruation and endometriosis, and was not marketed for use as an oral contraceptive until 1962. On a molecular level, progestins like norethisterone exert their effects on target cells via binding to progesterone receptors that result in downstream changes to target genes. Target cells are found in the reproductive tract, breast, pituitary, hypothalamus, skeletal tissue, and central nervous system. Contraceptive efficacy is derived mainly from changes to the cervical mucus, wherein norethisterone increases the cell content and viscosity of the mucous to impede sperm transport and migration. Norethisterone also induces a variety of changes to the endometrium - including atrophy, irregular secretion, and suppressed proliferation - that make it inhospitable for implantation. Working via a negative feedback loop, norethisterone also acts on both the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary to suppress the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary. Suppression of these hormones prevents follicular development, ovulation, and corpus luteum development.  Norethisterone is 38% bound to sex hormone-binding globulin and 61% bound to albumin. Norethisterone is a synthetic oral progestin used for contraception or to treat other hormone-related conditions such as menopausal symptoms and endometriosis. As a synthetic progestin, norethisterone acts similarly to endogenous progesterone but with a much higher potency - it acts at the pelvic level to alter cervical and endometrial function, as well as via the inhibition of pituitary hormones that play a role in follicular maturation and ovulation. A small increase in the risk of developing breast cancer has been observed in patients using combined oral contraceptives, with some evidence also implicating progestin-only pills - patients starting hormonal contraception should be advised of this risk and should employ routine breast self-examinations to check for evidence of any developing masses. Norethisterone is indicated as an oral contraceptive when given as monotherapy or in combination with an estrogen component, such as or. In combination with an estrogen component, oral norethisterone is also indicated as a hormone replacement therapy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms arising from menopause.

      "Nateglinide_(14222),\"Nateglinide belongs to drug node. Nateglinide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It belongs to the meglitinide class of short-acting insulin secretagogues, which act by binding to β cells of the pancreas to stimulate insulin release. Nateglinide is an amino acid derivative that induces an early insulin response to meals decreasing postprandial blood glucose levels. It should only be taken with meals and meal-time doses should be skipped with any skipped meal. Approximately one month of therapy is required before a decrease in fasting blood glucose is seen. Meglitnides may have a neutral effect on weight or cause a slight increase in weight. The average weight gain caused by meglitinides appears to be lower than that caused by sulfonylureas and insulin and appears to occur only in those naïve to oral antidiabetic agents. Due to their mechanism of action, meglitinides may cause hypoglycemia although the risk is thought to be lower than that of sulfonylureas since their action is dependent on the presence of glucose. In addition to reducing postprandial and fasting blood glucose, meglitnides have been shown to decrease glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, which are reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control. Meglitinides appear to be more effective at lowering postprandial blood glucose than metformin, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones. Nateglinide is extensively metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine (83%) and feces (10%). The major metabolites possess less activity than the parent compound. One minor metabolite, the isoprene, has the same potency as its parent compound. Nateglinide activity is dependent on the presence functioning β cells and glucose. In contrast to sulfonylurea insulin secretatogogues, nateglinide has no effect on insulin release in the absence of glucose. Rather, it potentiates the effect of extracellular glucose on ATP-sensitive potassium channel and has little effect on insulin levels between meals and overnight. As such, nateglinide is more effective at reducing postprandial blood glucose levels than fasting blood glucose levels and requires a longer duration of therapy (approximately one month) before decreases in fasting blood glucose are observed. The insulinotropic effects of nateglinide are highest at intermediate glucose levels (3 to 10 mmol/L) and it does not increase insulin release already stimulated by high glucose concentrations (greater than 15 mmol/L). Nateglinide appears to be selective for pancreatic β cells and does not appear to affect skeletal or cardiac muscle or thyroid tissue. 98% bound to serum proteins, primarily serum albumin and to a lesser extent &alpha;1 acid glycoprotein Insulin secretion by pancreatic β cells is partly controlled by cellular membrane potential. Membrane potential is regulated through an inverse relationship between the activity of cell membrane ATP-sensitive potassium channels (ABCC8) and extracellular glucose concentrations. Extracellular glucose enters the cell via GLUT2 (SLC2A2) transporters. Once inside the cell, glucose is metabolized to produce ATP. High concentrations of ATP inhibit ATP-sensitive potassium channels causing membrane depolarization. When extracellular glucose concentrations are low, ATP-sensitive potassium channels open causing membrane repolarization. High glucose concentrations cause ATP-sensitive potassium channels to close resulting in membrane depolarization and opening of L-type calcium channels. The influx of calcium ions stimulates calcium-dependent exocytosis of insulin granules. Nateglinide increases insulin release by inhibiting ATP-sensitive potassium channels in a glucose-dependent manner.  For the treatment of non-insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus in conjunction with diet and exercise.\"\n",

Risperidone is a second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) medication used in the treatment of a number of mood and mental health conditions including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. It is one of the most widely used SGAs. , another commonly used SGA, is the primary active metabolite of risperidone (i.e. 9-hydroxyrisperidone). Though its precise mechanism of action is not fully understood, current focus is on the ability of risperidone to inhibit the D2 dopaminergic receptors and 5-HT2A serotonergic receptors in the brain. Schizophrenia is thought to result from an excess of dopaminergic D2 and serotonergic 5-HT2A activity, resulting in overactivity of central mesolimbic pathways and mesocortical pathways, respectively. Risperidone and its active metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, are ~88% and ~77% protein-bound in human plasma, respectively. They each bind to both serum albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. The primary action of risperidone is to decrease dopaminergic and serotonergic pathway activity in the brain, therefore decreasing symptoms of schizophrenia and mood disorders. Risperidone is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and irritability associated with autistic disorder. It is also indicated as monotherapy, or adjunctly with lithium or valproic acid, for the treatment of acute mania or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder.\"\n",

Irinotecan prevents religation of the DNA strand by binding to topoisomerase I-DNA complex. The formation of this ternary complex interferes with the moving replication fork, which induces replication arrest and lethal double-stranded breaks in DNA. As a result, DNA damage is not efficiently repaired and apoptosis (programmed cell death) occurs. 30%-68% protein bound, mainly to albumin.  Irinotecan is an antineoplastic enzyme inhibitor primarily used in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Irinotecan is a semisynthetic derivative of camptothecin. Camptothecins interact specifically with topoisomerase I, an enzyme in the cell nucleus that regulates DNA topology and facilitates nuclear processes such as DNA replication, recombination, and repair. During these processes, topoisomerase I relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single-strand breaks, allowing single DNA strands to pass through the break. The 3'-DNA terminus of the broken DNA strands bind covalently with the topoisomerase enzyme to form a catalytic intermediate called a cleavable complex. After the DNA is sufficiently relaxed and the strand passage reaction is complete, DNA topoisomerase reattaches the broken DNA strands to form the chemically unaltered topoisomers that allow transcription to proceed. Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 bind to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevent religation of these single-strand breaks. Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA, and either Irinotecan or SN-38. Mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double-strand breaks. The precise contribution of SN-38 to the activity of irinotecan in humans is not known. Irinotecan is cell cycle phase-specific (S-phase). For the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (first-line therapy when administered with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin). Also used in combination with cisplatin for the treatment of extensive small cell lung cancer. Irinotecan is currently under investigation for the treatment of metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer. Also used in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin for the treatment of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas after disease progression following gemcitabine-based therapy. \"\n",
      "Olopatadine_(14232),\"Olopatadine belongs to drug node. Olopatadine is a selective histamine H1 antagonist and mast cell stabilizer that works by attenuating inflammatory and allergic reactions. It is a structural analog of , which has a minimal anti-allergic activity. Olopatadine works by blocking the effects of histamine, which is a primary inflammatory mediator that causes inflammatory and allergic reactions. An ophthalmic solution of olopatadine was approved by the FDA and European Union for the treatment of seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis in 1996 and 2002, respectively. In comparison to other anti-allergenic ophthalmic medications, olopatadine displays a good comfort and tolerability profile since it does not cause perturbation of cell membranes. Olopatadine is used for the symptomatic treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis in ophthalmic formulations and seasonal allergic rhinitis in intranasal formulations. It is currently marketed under several brand names, including Pazeo, Patanase, and Opatanol. Histamine is a biogenic vasoactive amine that binds to its receptors, which are G-protein coupled receptors. Signaling through the histamine H1 receptor is thought to primarily promote the activation of inflammatory reactions, such as allergy, asthma, and autoimmune diseases. H1 receptor signaling activates the intracellular transcription factors, such as IP3, PLC, PKC, DAG, and intracellular calcium ions, which all work to activate further downstream cascades. Activated downstream cascades lead to the production of cytokines, the release of mast cell inflammatory mediators, synthesis of prostacyclins, activation of platelet factor, as well as the synthesis of nitric oxide, arachidonic acid, and thromboxane, which all contribute to inflammatory reactions.  About 55% of total olopatadine is bound to human serum proteins, with serum albumin being the primary protein of binding. Inflammatory reactions in response to various stimuli are mediated by endogenous mediators and other pro-inflammatory factors. Histamine receptor activation and mast cell degranulation are primary mechanisms that cause inflammatory reactions such as ocular itching, hyperemia, chemosis, eyelid swelling, and tearing of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. Olopatadine is an anti-allergenic molecule and mast cell stabilizer that inhibits the _in vivo_ type 1 immediate hypersensitivity reaction. By blocking the effects of histamine, olopatadine works to reduce the symptoms of allergies and inflammation at various sites of administration, including the eyes and nose. It has shown to exert antihistaminic effects in isolated tissues, animal models, and humans. Olopatadine also demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of immunologically-stimulated release of histamine from rat basophilic leukemia cells and human conjunctival mast cells _in vitro_. Olopatadine has a relatively rapid onset of action and prolonged duration, where it was shown to mediate anti-histaminic effects at 5 minutes to 24 hours post-administration. Olopatadine is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis as ophthalmic solution.\"\n",
      "Oxcarbazepine_(14234),\"Oxcarbazepine belongs to drug node. Oxcarbazepine is an anti-epileptic medication used in the treatment of partial onset seizures that was first approved for use in the United States in 2000. It is a structural derivative of and exerts a majority of its activity via a pharmacologically active metabolite, MHD, which exists as a racemate in the blood - a pro-drug of the more active (S)-etiomer is also marketed as a separate anti-epileptic under the name. Compared to other anti-epileptic drugs, which are generally metabolized via the cytochrome P450 system, oxcarbazepine has a reduced propensity for involvement in drug-drug interactions owing to its primarily reductive metabolism. The exact mechanism through which oxcarbazepine and its active metaoblite, MHD, exert their anti-epileptic effects is unclear, but is thought to primarily involve the blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels. The opening and closing of sodium channels allows for the propagation of action potentials along neurons - in epilepsy, these action potentials can occur in excess of that required for normal function, and the repetitive and pathological firing of these action potentials leads to seizure activity. Both oxcarbazepine and MHD are thought to inhibit seizure activity by binding to the inactive state of voltage-gated sodium channels, thus prolonging the period in which the receptor is unavailable for action potential propagation. This helps to stabilize hyperexcited neuronal membranes, inhibit repetitive neuron firing, and prevent the spread of seizure activity within the CNS without affecting normal neuronal transmission. The pharmacologically active metabolite of oxcarbazepine, MHD, is approximately 40% bound to plasma proteins, predomitly albumin. Oxcarbazepine is an anticonvulsant drug that reduces the incidence of seizures in epilepsy by inhibiting abnormal electrical activity in the brain. In the United States, oxcarbazepine is indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 4 years of age and older, and as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 2 years of age and older. In Canada, oxcarbazepine is indicated for use as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 6 years of age and older.\"\n",
      "Estradiol_(14235),\"Estradiol belongs to drug node. Estradiol is a naturally occurring hormone circulating endogenously in females. It is commercially available in several hormone therapy products for managing conditions associated with reduced estrogen, such as vulvovaginal atrophy and hot flashes. Some available forms of estradiol include oral tablets, injections, vaginal rings, transdermal patches, sprays, gels, and creams.  Estrogen is found in the the breast, uterine, ovarian, skin, prostate, bone, fat, and brain tissues. The main source of estrogen in adult women during the reproductive period of life is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol each day. After menopause, however, the majority of endogenous estrogen is produced by transformation of androstenedione (which is secreted by the adrenal cortex) to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Both estrone and its sulphate conjugated form, estrone sulphate, represent the most abundant estrogens found in postmenopausal women.  More than 95% of estrogens are found to circulate in the blood bound to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin. Estradiol acts on the on the estrogen receptors to relieve vasomotor systems (such as hot flashes) and urogenital symptoms (such as vaginal dryness and dyspareunia). Estradiol is indicated in various preparations for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and vulvar and vaginal atrophy due to menopause, for the treatment of hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism, castration, or primary ovarian failure, and for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis. It is also used for the treatment of breast cancer (only for palliation therapy) in certain men or women with metastatic disease, and for the treatment of androgen-dependent prostate cancer (only for palliation therapy). It is also used in combination with other hormones as a component of oral contraceptive pills for preventing pregcy (most commonly as , a synthetic form of estradiol).\"\n",
      "Naproxen_(14238),\"Naproxen belongs to drug node. Naproxen is classified as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory dug (NSAID) and was initially approved for prescription use in 1976 and then for over-the-counter (OTC) use in 1994. It can effectively manage acute pain as well as pain related to rheumatic diseases, and has a well studied adverse effect profile. Given its overall tolerability and effectiveness, naproxen can be considered a first line treatment for a variety of clinical situations requiring analgesia. Naproxen is available in both immediate and delayed release formulations, in combination with sumatriptan to treat migraines, and in combination with esomeprazole to lower the risk of developing gastric ulcers. As with other non-selective NSAIDs, naproxen exerts it's clinical effects by blocking COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes leading to decreased prostaglandin synthesis. Although both enzymes contribute to prostaglandin production, they have unique functional differences. The COX-1 enzymes is constitutively active and can be found in normal tissues such as the stomach lining, while the COX-2 enzyme is inducible and produces prostaglandins that mediate pain, fever and inflammation. The COX-2 enzyme mediates the desired antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties offered by Naproxen, while undesired adverse effects such as gastrointestinal upset and renal toxicities are linked to the COX-1 enzyme. Naproxen is highly protein bound with >99% of the drug bound to albumin at therapeutic levels. Naproxen is an established non-selective NSAID and is useful as an analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic. Similar to other NSAIDs, the pharmacological activity of naproxen can be attributed to the inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase, which in turn reduces prostaglandin synthesis in various tissues and fluids including the synovial fluid, gastric mucosa, and the blood.  Naproxen is indicated for the management of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, tendinitis, bursitis, acute gout, primary dysmenorrhea, and for the relief of mild to moderate pain. Further, it is first-line therapy for osteoarthritis, acute gouty arthritis, dysmenorrhea, and musculoskeletal inflammation and pain.\"\n",
      "Alfentanil_(14239),\"Alfentanil belongs to drug node. A short-acting opioid anesthetic and analgesic derivative of fentanyl. It produces an early peak analgesic effect and fast recovery of consciousness. Alfentanil is effective as an anesthetic during surgery, for supplementation of analgesia during surgical procedures, and as an analgesic for critically ill patients. Opiate receptors are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as both positive and negative regulators of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin and glucagon. Alfentanil's analgesic activity is, most likely, due to its conversion to morphine. Opioids close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP2-receptor agonist) and open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels (OP3 and OP1 receptor agonist). This results in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability. 92% Alfentanil is a synthetic opioid analgesic. Alfentanil interacts predominately with the opioid mu-receptor. These mu-binding sites are discretely distributed in the human brain, spinal cord, and other tissues. In clinical settings, alfentanil exerts its principal pharmacologic effects on the central nervous system. Its primary actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation. Alfentanil may increase the patient's tolerance for pain and decrease the perception of suffering, although the presence of the pain itself may still be recognized. In addition to analgesia, alterations in mood, euphoria and dysphoria, and drowsiness commonly occur. Alfentanil depresses the respiratory centers, depresses the cough reflex, and constricts the pupils. For the management of postoperative pain and the maintece of general anesthesia.\"\n",
      "Fentanyl_(14241),\"Fentanyl belongs to drug node. Fentanyl, a potent opioid agonist, was developed in the 1950s to fill a need for strong and rapid analgesia. Because of these characteristics, fentanyl is commonly used to treat chronic cancer pain or in anesthesia. Fentanyl is related to other opioids like and. Fentanyl binds to opioid receptors, especially the mu opioid receptor, which are coupled to G-proteins. Activation of opioid receptors causes GTP to be exchanged for GDP on the G-proteins which in turn down regulates adenylate cyclase, reducing concentrations of cAMP. Reduced cAMP decreases cAMP dependant influx of calcium ions into the cell. The exchange of GTP for GDP results in hyperpolarization of the cell and inhibition of nerve activity. Fentanyl is 80-85% bound to plasma proteins. In one study, a 0.1µg/L solution of fentanyl was 77.9±1.1% bound to human serum albumin and 12.0±5.4% bound to α-1 acid glycoprotein. A 0.1µg/L solution of norfentanyl, the primary metabolite of fentanyl, was 7.62±1.2% bound to human serum albumin and 7.24±1.9% bound to α-1 acid glycoprotein. Fentanyl produces strong analgesia through its activation of opioid receptors. It has a duration of action of several hours and a wider therapeutic index as patients develop tolerance to opioids. Fentanyl is associated with a risk of addiction and abuse and should not be mixed with alcohol or benzodiazepines. Fentanyl intravenous or intramuscular injections are indicated for short term analgesia during induction, maintece, and recovery from general or regional anesthesia. These injections are also used with a neuroleptic for premedication, induction, and as an adjunct to maintece of anesthesia. Finally, fentanyl intravenous or intramuscular injections are used with oxygen for anesthesia in high risk patients.\"\n",
      "Propofol_(14244),\"Propofol belongs to drug node. Propofol is an intravenous anaesthetic agent used for induction and maintece of general anaesthesia. IV administration of propfol is used to induce unconsciousness after which anaesthesia may be maintained using a combination of medications. Recovery from propofol-induced anaesthesia is generally rapid and associated with less frequent side effects (e.g. drowsiness, nausea, vomiting) than with thiopental, methohexital, and etomidate. Propofol may be used prior to diagnostic procedures requiring anaesthesia, in the management of refractory status epilepticus, and for induction and/or maintece of anaesthesia prior to and during surgeries. The action of propofol involves a positive modulation of the inhibitory function of the neurotransmitter gama-aminobutyric acid (GABA) through GABA-A receptors. 95 to 99%, primarily to serum albumin and hemoglobin Propofol is a sedative-hypnotic agent for use in the induction and maintece of anesthesia or sedation. Intravenous injection of a therapeutic dose of propofol produces hypnosis rapidly with minimal excitation, usually within 40 seconds from the start of an injection (the time for one arm-brain circulation). Used for induction and/or maintece of anaesthesia and for management of refractory status epilepticus. \"\n",
      "Diazepam_(14245),\"Diazepam belongs to drug node. A benzodiazepine with anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, sedative, muscle relaxant, and amnesic properties and a long duration of action. Its actions are mediated by enhancement of gamma-aminobutyric acid activity. It is used in the treatment of severe anxiety disorders, as a hypnotic in the short-term management of insomnia, as a sedative and premedicant, as an anticonvulsant, and in the management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p589) Diazepam is a benzodiazepine tranquilliser with anticonvulsant, sedative, muscle relaxant and amnesic properties. Despite high binding to plasma proteins (98-99%) - mainly albumin and to a lesser extent α1-acid glycoprotein - diazepam is widely distributed into tissues and crosses the blood-brain barrier and is highly lipid soluble, which causes the initial effects to decrease rapidly as it is redistributed into fat deposits and tissues. Diazepam is a benzodiazepine that exerts anxiolytic, sedative, muscle- relaxant, anticonvulsant and amnestic effects. Most of these effects are thought to result from facilitation of the action of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. In general, diazepam is useful in the symptomatic management of mild to moderate degrees of anxiety in conditions dominated by tension, excitation, agitation, fear, or aggressiveness such as may occur in psychoneurosis, anxiety reactions due to stress conditions, and anxiety states with somatic expression.\"\n",
      "Clofazimine_(14247),\"Clofazimine belongs to drug node. Clofazimine is a highly lipophilic antimicrobial riminophenazine dye used in combination with other agents, such as , for the treatment of leprosy. It was originally described in 1957 and was the prototypical riminophenazine dye - a bright-red dye that, in its clinical use, results in long-lasting discoloration of the skin and bodily fluids. Although it carries _in vitro_ activity against other mycobacterium, such as _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, it is generally considered an ineffective treatment in comparison to classic tuberculosis treatments such as and. Although the precise mechanism(s) of action of clofazimine have not been elucidated, its antimicrobial activity appears to be membrane-directed. It was previously thought that, due to its lipophilicity, clofazimine participated in the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) via redox cycling, specifically H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and superoxide, which then exerted an antimicrobial effect. A more recent and compelling theory involves clofazimine interacting with bacterial membrane phospholipids to generate antimicrobial lysophospholipids - bactericidal efficacy may, then, arise from the combined membrane-destabilizing effects of both clofazimine and lysophospholipids, which interfere with K+ uptake and, ultimately, ATP production. Clofazimine is bound primarily to beta-lipoproteins (and, to a lesser extent, alpha-lipoproteins) in the serum. This binding was saturable at concentrations of ~10 µg/mL. Binding to gamma-globulin and albumin is negligible. Clofazimine exerts a slow bactericidal effect on <i>Mycobacterium leprae</i> (Hansen's bacillus) due primarily to its action on the bacterial outer membrane, though there is some evidence that activity on the bacterial respiratory chain and ion transporters may play a role. It also exerts anti-inflammatory properties due to the suppression of T-lymphocyte activity. Clofazimine has a relatively long duration of action owing to its long residence time in the body, but is still administered daily. Clofazimine is indicated for the treatment of lepromatous leprosy, including dapsone-resistant lepromatous leprosy and lepromatous leprosy complicated by erythema nodosum leprosum. To prevent the development of drug resistance, it should be used only in combination with other antimycobacterial leprosy treatments.\"\n",
      "Cysteamine_(14248),\"Cysteamine belongs to drug node. Cystinosis is a rare disease caused by mutations in the CTNS gene that encodes for cystinosin, a protein responsible for transporting cystine out of the cell lysosome. A defect in cystinosin function is followed by cystine accumulation throughout the body, especially the eyes and kidneys. Individuals born without the ability to metabolize cystine suffer from cystinosis, a rare genetic disorder characterized by the widespread accumulation of cystine crystals throughout the body and eye tissues. The cystine crystals may cause considerable damage, particularly in the renal tissues and corneal tissues. In some cases, renal failure can occur during childhood if the condition is left untreated. Other organs that may be affected by cystinosis include the CNS, thyroid, pancreas, muscle tissues, and gonads.  Cysteamine is 52% plasma protein bound, and is mostly bound to albumin. Cystine accumulation is the cause of organ damage in cystinosis. Cysteamine prevents the accumulation of cystine crystals in the body and is specifically prescribed to prevent kidney and eye damage. Cysteamine converts cystine into a form that may easily exit cells, preventing harmful accumulation. The bitartrate salt of cysteamine is used for the oral treatment of nephropathic cystinosis and cystinuria in children 6 years old and above, and adults. The hydrochloride salt, used in eye drop preparations, is indicated for the treatment of corneal cystine crystal accumulation in patients with cystinosis.\"\n",

      "Liothyronine_(14059),\"Liothyronine belongs to drug node. Liothyronine is a thyroidal hormone T3 which is normally produced by the thyroid gland in a ratio 4:1 when compared with T4: T3. Liothyronine is the active form of thyroxine which is composed in a basic chemical structure by a tyrosine with bound iodine. The exogenous liothyronine product was developed by King Pharmaceuticals and FDA approved in 1956. Liothyronine replaces endogenous thyroid hormone and then exerts its physiologic effects by controlling DNA transcription and protein synthesis. This effect on DNA is obtained by the binding of liothyronine to the thyroid receptors attached to DNA. Exogenous liothyronine exerts all the normal effects of the endogenous thyroid T3 hormone. Hence, it increases energy expenditure, accelerates the rate of cellular oxidation stimulating growth, maturation, and metabolism of the body tissues, aids in myelination of nerves and development of synaptic processes in the nervous system and enhances carbohydrate and protein metabolism. Liothyronine presents a very large binding to plasma proteins and around 99.7% of the administered dose can be found bound. Liothyronine is found to be bound to thyroxine-binding globulin, thyroxine-binding prealbumin and albumin. It is important to consider that only the little unbound portion of liothyronine is metabolically active. In hormonal replacement, liothyronine is more potent and present a faster action when compared to levothyroxine but the time of action is significantly shorter. The type of treatment needs to be well evaluated as the fast correction of thyroid hormones in certain diseases presents additional risks such as heart failure. The onset of activity is observed a few hours after administration and the maximum effect is observed after 2-3 days. Liothyronine is officially approved for the following indications:\"\n",
      "Levothyroxine_(14060),\"Levothyroxine belongs to drug node. Levothyroxine is a synthetically produced form of thyroxine, a major endogenous hormone secreted by the thyroid gland. Also known as L-thyroxine or the brand name product Synthroid, levothyroxine is used primarily to treat hypothyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland is no longer able to produce sufficient quantities of the thyroid hormones T<sub>4</sub> (tetraiodothyronine or thyroxine) and T<sub>3</sub> (triiodothyronine or ), resulting in diminished down-stream effects of these hormones. Without sufficient quantities of circulating thyroid hormones, symptoms of hypothyroidism begin to develop such as fatigue, increased heart rate, depression, dry skin and hair, muscle cramps, constipation, weight gain, memory impairment, and poor tolerance to cold temperatures. Levothyroxine is a synthetically prepared levo-isomer of the thyroid hormone thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>, a tetra-iodinated tyrosine derivative) that acts as a replacement in deficiency syndromes such as hypothyroidism. T<sub>4</sub> is the major hormone secreted from the thyroid gland and is chemically identical to the naturally secreted T<sub>4</sub>: it increases metabolic rate, decreases thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) production from the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland, and, in peripheral tissues, is converted to T<sub>3</sub>. Thyroxine is released from its precursor protein thyroglobulin through proteolysis and secreted into the blood where is it then peripherally deiodinated to form triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>) which exerts a broad spectrum of stimulatory effects on cell metabolism. T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> have a relative potency of ~1:4.  Circulating thyroid hormones are greater than 99% bound to plasma proteins, including thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), thyroxine-binding prealbumin (TBPA) and albumin (TBA). The higher affinity of both TBG and TBPA for T4 partially explains the higher serum levels, slower metabolic clearance and longer half-life of T4 compared to T3. Protein-bound thyroid hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with small amounts of free hormone where only unbound hormone is metabolically active. Oral levothyroxine is a synthetic hormone that exerts the same physiologic effect as endogenous T<sub>4</sub>, thereby maintaining normal T<sub>4</sub> levels when a deficiency is present.  Levothyroxine is indicated as replacement therapy in primary (thyroidal), secondary (pituitary) and tertiary (hypothalamic) congenital or acquired hypothyroidism. It is also indicated as an adjunct to surgery and radioiodine therapy in the management of thyrotropin-dependent well-differentiated thyroid cancer.\"\n",
      "Diclofenac_(14061),\"Diclofenac belongs to drug node. Diclofenac is a phenylacetic acid derivative and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and-2 which are the enzyme responsible for producing prostaglandins (PGs). PGs contribute to inflammation and pain signalling. Diclofenac, like other NSAIDs, is often used as first line therapy for acute and chronic pain and inflammation from a variety of causes. Diclofenac was the product of rational drug design based on the structures of , , and. The addition of two chlorine groups in the ortho position of the phenyl ring locks the ring in maximal torsion which appears to be related to increased potency. It is often used in combination with to prevent NSAID-induced gastric ulcers. Diclofenac was first approved by the FDA in July 1988 under the trade name Voltaren, marketed by Novartis (previously Ciba-Geigy). Diclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 and -2, the enzymes responsible for production of prostaglandin (PG) G<sub>2</sub> which is the precursor to other PGs. These molecules have broad activity in pain and inflammation and the inhibition of their production is the common mechanism linking each effect of diclofenac. Diclofenac is over 99.7% bound to serum proteins, primarily albumin. It is undergoes limited binding to lipoproteins as well with 1.1% bound to HDL, 0.3% to LDL, and 0.15% to VLDL. Diclofenac reduces inflammation and by extension reduces nociceptive pain and combats fever. It also increases the risk of developing a gastrointestinal ulcer by inhibiting the production of protective mucus in the stomach. Diclofenac is indicated for use in the treatment of pain and inflammation from varying sources including inflammatory conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and akylosing spondylitis, as well as injury-related inflammation due to surgery and physical trauma. It is often used in combination with as a gastro-protective agent in patients with high risk of developing NSAID-induced ulcers.\"\n",
      "Liotrix_(14064),\"Liotrix belongs to drug node. Liotrix is a synthetically derived thyroid hormone replacement preparation. It consists of levothyroxine sodium (thyroxine, T4) and liothyronine sodium (triiodothyronine, T3) in a 4 to 1 ratio by weight. Liotrix was developed when it was believed that serum levels of both T4 and T3 were maintained by direct thyroidal secretion. It is now known that the thyroid gland secretes approximately ten times more T4 than T3 and that 80% of serum T3 is derived from deiodination of T4 in peripheral tissues. Administration of levothyroxine alone is sufficient for maintaining serum T4 and T3 levels in most patients and combination hormone replacement therapy generally offers no therapeutic advantage. In fact, administration of T3 may result in supratherapeutic levels of T3. The hormones, T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub>, are tyrosine-based hormones produced by the thyroid gland. Iodine is an important component in their synthesis. The major secreted form of thyroid hormone is T4. T4 is converted T3, the more active thyroid hormone, by deiodinases in peripheral tissues. T3 acts in the body to increase basal metabolic rate, alter protein synthesis and increase the body's sensitivity to catecholamines (such as adrenaline). Thyroid hormones are essential for proper development and differentiation of all cells of the human body. T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> regulate protein, fat and carbohydrate metabolism to varying extents. The most pronounced effect of the hormones is in altering how human cells use energetic compounds. The thyroid hormone derivatives bind to the thyroid hormone receptors initially to initiate their downstream effects.  Thyroid hormone drugs are natural or synthetic preparations containing T<sub>4</sub> or T<sub>3</sub> or both. T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> are produced in the human thyroid gland by the iodination and coupling of the amino acid tyrosine. Liotrix is a synthetic preparation of T4 and T3 in a 4:1 weight-based ratio. These hormones enhance oxygen consumption by most tissues of the body and increase the basal metabolic rate and the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins. Thus, they exert a profound influence on every organ system in the body and are of particular importance in the development of the central nervous system. May be used to treat primary, secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism. May also be used to suppress thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion in patients with simple (nontoxic) goiter, subacute or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis multinodular goiter, and in the management of thyroid cancer. May be used in conjunction with other antithyroid agents to treat thyrotoxicosis to prevent goitrogenesis and hypothyroidism. May also be used for differential diagnosis of suspected mild hyperthyroidism or thyroid gland autonomy.\"\n",

      "Resveratrol_(14072),\"Resveratrol belongs to drug node. Resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) is a polyphenolic phytoalexin. It is a stilbenoid, a derivate of stilbene, and is produced in plants with the help of the enzyme stilbene synthase. It exists as cis-(Z) and trans-(E) isomers. The trans- form can undergo isomerisation to the cis- form when heated or exposed to ultraviolet irradiation. In a 2004 issue of Science, Dr. Sinclair of Harvard University said resveratrol is not an easy molecule to protect from oxidation. It has been claimed that it is readily degraded by exposure to light, heat, and oxygen. However, studies find that Trans-resveratrol undergoes negligible oxidation in normal atmosphere at room temperature. Resveratrol suppresses NF-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation in HSV infected cells. Reports have indicated that HSV activates NF-kappaB during productive infection and this may be an essential aspect of its replication scheme.  Strong affinity towards protein binding. Resveratrol, a phytoalexin, has been found to inhibit herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) replication in a dose-dependent, reversible manner, although this is only one of its many pharmaceutical properties. In some countries where there is higher consumption of red wine, there appears to be a lower incidence of heart disease. Other benefits of resveratrol include its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. In preclinical studies, Resveratrol has been found to have potential anticancer properties. Being investigated for the treatment of Herpes labialis infections (cold sores).\"\n",
      "Glycyrrhizic acid_(14107),\"Glycyrrhizic acid belongs to drug node. Glycyrrhizic acid is extracted from the root of the licorice plant; _Glycyrrhiza glabra_. It is a triterpene glycoside with glycyrrhetinic acid that possesses a wide range of pharmacological and biological activities. When extracted from the plant, it can be obtained in the form of ammonium glycyrrhizin and mono-ammonium glycyrrhizin. Glycyrrhizic acid has been developed in Japan and China as a hepatoprotective drug in cases of chronic hepatitis. From January 2014, glycyrrhizic acid as part of the licorice extract was approved by the FDA as an existing food sweetener. It was approved by Health Canada to be used in over-the-counter products but all the products are currently on the status canceled post marketed. Glycyrrhizic acid can be found in the alpha and beta forms. The alpha form is predomit in the liver and duodenum and thus, it is thought that the anti-inflammatory liver effect of this drug are mainly due to the action of this isomer. Glycyrrhizic acid anti-inflammatory effect is generated via suppression of TNF alpha and caspase 3. It also inhibits the translocation of NFkB into the nuclei and conjugates free radicals. Some studies have shown a glycyrrhizic-driven inhibition of CD4+ T cell proliferation via JNK, ERK and PI3K/AKT. Glycyrrhizic acid does not bind to any plasma proteins as it is not absorbed systemically. On the other hand, its main active metabolite, glycyrrhetinic acid presents a very large binding to serum proteins such as albumin. Glycyrrhizic acid was reported to present antiallergic, antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities as well as improvements in glucose tolerance.  Glycyrrhizic acid is widely applied in foods as a natural sweetener. As a therapeutic agent, is has been used in a vast variety of formulations as it is reported to be anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcer, anti-allergic, antioxidant, anti-tumor, anti-diabetic and hepatoprotective.

It is also known to be used as a remedy for peptic ulcer and other stomach diseases.\"\n",
      "Ubidecarenone_(14108),\"Ubidecarenone belongs to drug node. Ubidecarenone, also called coenzyme Q10, is a 1,4-benzoquinone. From his name (Q10), the Q refers to the constitutive quinone group, and 10 is related to the number of isoprenyl subunits in its tail. It is a powerful antioxidant, a lipid-soluble and essential cofactor in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. The ubidecarenone is the coenzyme destined for mitochondrial enzyme complexes involved in oxidative phosphorylation in the production of ATP. It is fundamental for cells that have a high metabolic demand. Ubidecarenone is sold as a dietary supplement and is not FDA approved as a drug thus, it is not meant to treat, cure or prevent any disease. FDA does not approve this dietary supplements before sold nor regulate the manufacturing process. Ubidecarenone is an essential cofactor in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Its functions are the acceptance of electrons from the complex I and II and this activity is vital for the production of ATP. It acts as a mobile redox agent shuttling electrons and protons in the electron transport chain. Ubidecarenone also presents antioxidant activity in mitochondria and cellular membranes, protecting against peroxidation of lipid membranes as well as inhibiting oxidation of LDL-cholesterol. In the blood, ubidecarenone is split into the various lipoprotein particles including LDL and VLDL. The plasma concentration of ubidecarenone is highly dependent on the presence of plasma lipoproteins and about 95% of the administered form is found in the reduced form.

      "Alitretinoin_(14111),\"Alitretinoin belongs to drug node. An important regulator of gene expression during growth and development, and in neoplasms. Tretinoin, also known as retinoic acid and derived from maternal vitamin A, is essential for normal growth; and embryonic development. An excess of tretinoin can be teratogenic. It is used in the treatment of psoriasis; acne vulgaris; and several other skin diseases. It has also been approved for use in promyelocytic leukemia (leukemia, promyelocytic, acute). Alitretinoin binds to and activates all known intracellular retinoid receptor subtypes (RARa, RARb, RARg, RXRa, RXRb and RXRg). Once activated these receptors function as transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes that control the process of cellular differentiation and proliferation in both normal and neoplastic cells.  Alitretinoin (9-<i>cis</i>-retinoic acid) is a naturally-occurring endogenous retinoid indicated for topical treatment of cutaneous lesions in patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma.

      "Gallium nitrate_(14116),\"Gallium nitrate belongs to drug node. Gallium nitrate is a drug that is used to treat hyper-calcemia, or too much calcium in the blood. This condition may occur when individuals develop various types of cancer. Gallium nitrate is also known by the common brand name Ganite. Gallium nitrate is believed to exert a hypocalcemic effect by inhibiting calcium resorption from bone. Gallium nitrate localizes preferentially where bone resorption and remodeling is occurring, and inhibits osteoclast activity. Inhibition of resorption may occur via a reduction in increased bone turnover. It seems to enhance hydroxyapatite function, inhibit osteocalcin, and inhibit the vacuolar ATPase on the osteoclast ruffled membrane. All these aid in the reduction of bone resorption.  Gallium nitrate exerts hypocalcemic effect by inhibiting calcium resorption from bone, possibly by stabilizing bone matrix, thereby reducing increased bone turnover. Gallium nitrate inhibits the growth of various lymphoma cell lines in vitro and exhibits antitumor activity in patients with lymphoma. The mechanism(s) of cytotoxicity is (are) only partly understood but appears to involve a two-step process: (1) targeting of gallium to cells, and (2) acting on multiple, specific intracellular processes. Gallium shares certain chemical properties with iron; therefore, it binds avidly to the iron transport protein transferrin. Transferrin-gallium complexes preferentially target cells that express transferrin receptors on their surface. Expression of transferrin receptors is particularly high on lymphoma cells. Cellular uptake of the gallium-transferrin complex leads to inhibition of cellular proliferation primarily via disruption of iron transport and homeostasis and blockade of ribonucleotide reductase. Recent studies have shown that cellular uptake of gallium leads to activation of caspases and induction of apoptosis. In phase II trials in patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma, the antitumor activity of gallium nitrate is similar to, or better than, that of other commonly used chemotherapeutic agents.  For the treatment of hypercalcemia. Also intended for the treatment of non-hodgkin's lymphoma.\"\n",
      "Rose bengal_(14118),\"Rose bengal belongs to drug node. Rose bengal is a pink stain derived as an analogue of fluorescein. Its disodium salt in ophthalmic solutions has been used as a diagnostic agent in suspected damage to conjunctival and corneal cells. It is also used in laboratory settings, including the preparation of Foraminifera for microscopic analysis and suppression of bacterial growth in several microbiological media. A direct cytotoxic effect of Rose bengal on microorganisms and cancer cells has been observed, questioning its potential antitumor actions via intralesional injections. The clinical applications of rose bengal as injectable formulation under the name PV-10 in melanoma, breast cancer and skin conditions such as eczema and psoriasis are being investigated in clinical trials. Rose Bengal stains both the nuclei and cell walls of dead or degenerated epithelial cells of the cornea and conjunctiva, and stain the mucus of the precorneal tear film. It is proposed that the staining ability of rose bengal is dependent on the status of tear film protection rather than cell viability, as tear components such as albumin and mucin can block the rose bengal uptake. It induces intrinsic cytotoxic effects by causing cellular morphologic changes, subsequent loss of cellular motility, cell detachment, and cell death. It mediates inhibitory actions on bovine corneal endothelial cells and attenuates cell proliferation.  Tear component comprising of different proteins, such as albumin (although not very common as tear component), lactoferrin, and transferrin, can bind to rose bengal dye and act as diffusion barrier to prevent dye uptake by cells and subsequent cell staining. Lysosymes in tear film can also bind to rose bengal to form precipitates to attenuate cell uptake.  Rose bengal is a staining agent that visualized ocular surfaces of both diseased and dead cells _in vivo_. It has also shown to stain healthy cultured cells, including rabbit corneal epithelial cells, in a rapid, dose-dependent manner. Various studies demonstrate the cytotoxic effects of rose bengal in different cell cultures, including smooth-muscle cells from human intestine, endothelial cells from bovinepulmonary artery, rabbit Tenon fibro-blasts, and rabbit and human corneal epithelial cells. Cellular morphological changes such as detachment, separation, loss of motility and disruption, in addition to swelling, intracytoplasmic vacuole formation and lysis have been manifested with the treatment of rose bengal , indicating that rose Bengal is not a vital dye.  Indicated as a diagnostic agent in routine ocular examinations or when superficial conjunctiva or corneal tissue change is suspected, and as an aid in the diagnosis of keratoconjunctivitis sicca, keratitis, abrasions or corrosions as well as the detection of foreign bodies.\"\n",
      "Octreotide_(14127),\"Octreotide belongs to drug node. Acromegaly is a disorder caused by excess growth hormone (GH), increasing the growth of body tissues and causing metabolic dysfunction. In most cases, it results from an anterior pituitary growth hormone-releasing tumor. Typically, the feet, hands, and face grow abnormally large; organomegaly and insulin resistance may also occur. Acromegaly is a life-threatening disease requiring life-long management. Octreotide binds to somatostatin receptors coupled to phospholipase C through G proteins and leads to smooth muscle contraction in the blood vessels. Downstream effects that stimulate phospholipase C, the production of 1, 4,5-inositol triphosphate, and action on the L-type calcium channels lead to the inhibition of growth hormone, treating the various growth-hormone and metabolic effects of acromegaly. Approximately 65% of the dose is bound in the plasma to lipoproteins and albumin. Octreotide mimics the naturally occurring hormone known as somatostatin. Like somatostatin, it demonstrates activity against growth hormone and glucagon, treating the disordered tissue growth and insulin regulation in patients with acromegaly. In addition, octreotide relieves the flushing and diarrhea associated with gastrointestinal tumors by reducing splanchnic blood flow and various gastrointestinal hormones associated with diarrhea. Octreotide by injection is used for the treatment of acromegaly and the reduction of flushing and diarrhea symptoms related to carcinoid tumors and/or vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIPoma) tumors.

      "Thiamine_(14130),\"Thiamine belongs to drug node. Thiamine or thiamin, also known as vitamin B1, is a colorless compound with the chemical formula C12H17N4OS. It is soluble in water and insoluble in alcohol. Thiamine decomposes if heated. Thiamine was first discovered by Umetaro Suzuki in Japan when researching how rice bran cured patients of Beriberi. Thiamine plays a key role in intracellular glucose metabolism and it is thought that thiamine inhibits the effect of glucose and insulin on arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation. Thiamine plays an important role in helping the body convert carbohydrates and fat into energy. It is essential for normal growth and development and helps to maintain proper functioning of the heart and the nervous and digestive systems. Thiamine cannot be stored in the body; however, once absorbed, the vitamin is concentrated in muscle tissue. It is thought that the mechanism of action of thiamine on endothelial cells is related to a reduction in intracellular protein glycation by redirecting the glycolytic flux. Thiamine is mainly the transport form of the vitamin, while the active forms are phosphorylated thiamine derivatives. Natural derivatives of thiamine phosphate, such as thiamine monophosphate (ThMP), thiamine diphosphate (ThDP), also sometimes called thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), thiamine triphosphate (ThTP), and thiamine triphosphate (AThTP), that act as coenzymes in addition to their each unique biological functions.  90-94% Thiamine is a vitamin with antioxidant, erythropoietic, cognition-and mood-modulatory, antiatherosclerotic, putative ergogenic, and detoxification activities. Thiamine has been found to protect against lead-induced lipid peroxidation in rat liver and kidney. Thiamine deficiency results in selective neuronal death in animal models. The neuronal death is associated with increased free radical production, suggesting that oxidative stress may play an important early role in brain damage associated with thiamine deficiency. Thiamine plays a key role in intracellular glucose metabolism and it is thought that thiamine inhibits the effect of glucose and insulin on arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation. Inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation may also promote atherosclerosis. Endothelial cells in culture have been found to have a decreased proliferative rate and delayed migration in response to hyperglycemic conditions. Thiamine has been shown to inhibit this effect of glucose on endothelial cells. For the treatment of thiamine and niacin deficiency states, Korsakov's alcoholic psychosis, Wernicke-Korsakov syndrome, delirium, and peripheral neuritis.\"\n",
      "Icosapent_(14131),\"Icosapent belongs to drug node. Important polyunsaturated fatty acid found in fish oils. It serves as the precursor for the prostaglandin-3 and thromboxane-3 families. A diet rich in eicosapentaenoic acid lowers serum lipid concentration, reduces incidence of cardiovascular disorders, prevents platelet aggregation, and inhibits arachidonic acid conversion into the thromboxane-2 and prostaglandin-2 families. The anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic and immunomodulatory actions of EPA is probably due to its role in eicosanoid physiology and biochemistry. Most eicosanoids are produced by the metabolism of omega-3 fatty acids, specifically, arachidonic acid. These eicosanoids, leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) stimulate leukocyte chemotaxis, platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. They are thrombogenic and artherogenic. On the other hand, EPA is metabolized to leukotriene B5 (LTB5) and thromboxane A3 (TXA3), which are eicosanoids that promote vasodilation, inhibit platelet aggregation and leukocyte chemotaxis and are anti-artherogenic and anti-thrombotic. The triglyceride-lowering effect of EPA results from inhibition of lipogenesis and stimulation of fatty acid oxidation. Fatty acid oxidation of EPA occurs mainly in the mitochondria. EPA is a substrate for Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1 and 2. It also appears to affect the function and bind to the Carbohydrate responsive element binding protein (ChREBP) and to a fatty acid receptor (G-coupled receptor) known as GP40.  Eicosanoids are chemical messengers derived from 20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids that play critical roles in immune and inflammatory responses. Both 20-carbon omega-6 fatty acids (arachidonic acid) and 20-carbon omega-3 fatty acids (EPA) can be found in cell membranes. During an inflammatory response, arachidonic acid and EPA are metabolized by enzymes known as cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases to form eicosanoids. Increasing omega-3 fatty acid intake increases the EPA content of cell membranes and decreases the arachidonic acid content, resulting in higher proportions of eicosanoids derived from EPA. Physiologic responses to arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoids differ from responses to EPA-derived eicosanoids. In general, eicosanoids derived from EPA are less potent inducers of inflammation, blood vessel constriction, and clotting than eicosanoids derived from arachidonic acid. EPA can be used for lowering elevated triglycerides in those who are hyperglyceridemic. In addition, EPA may play a therapeutic role in patients with cystic fibrosis by reducing disease severity and may play a similar role in type 2 diabetics in slowing the progression of diabetic nephropathy.\"\n",

      "Telmisartan_(15836),\"Telmisartan belongs to drug node. Telmisartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB) used in the management of hypertension. Generally, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) such as telmisartan bind to the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptors with high affinity, causing inhibition of the action of angiotensin II on vascular smooth muscle, ultimately leading to a reduction in arterial blood pressure. Recent studies suggest that telmisartan may also have PPAR-gamma agonistic properties that could potentially confer beneficial metabolic effects. Telmisartan interferes with the binding of angiotensin II to the angiotensin II AT<sub>1</sub>-receptor by binding reversibly and selectively to the receptors in vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. As angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor, which also stimulates the synthesis and release of aldosterone, blockage of its effects results in decreases in systemic vascular resistance. Telmisartan does not inhibit the angiotensin converting enzyme, other hormone receptors, or ion channels. Studies also suggest that telmisartan is a partial agonist of PPAR&gamma;, which is an established target for antidiabetic drugs. This suggests that telmisartan can improve carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, as well as control insulin resistance without causing the side effects that are associated with full PPAR&gamma; activators. Highly bound to plasma proteins (&gt;99.5%), mainly albumin and a1-acid glycoprotein. Binding is not dose-dependent. Telmisartan is an orally active nonpeptide angiotensin II antagonist that acts on the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor subtype. It has the highest affinity for the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor among commercially available ARBS and has minimal affinity for the AT<sub>2</sub> receptor. New studies suggest that telmisartan may also have PPAR&gamma; agonistic properties that could potentially confer beneficial metabolic effects, as PPAR&gamma; is a nuclear receptor that regulates specific gene transcription, and whose target genes are involved in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as anti-inflammatory responses. This observation is currently being explored in clinical trials. Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan works by blocking the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone secretory effects of angiotensin II. Used alone or in combination with other classes of antihypertensives for the treatment of hypertension. Also used in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as the treatment of congestive heart failure (only in patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors).\"\n",
      "Digoxin_(15840),\"Digoxin belongs to drug node. Digoxin is one of the oldest cardiovascular medications used today. It is a common agent used to manage atrial fibrillation and the symptoms of heart failure. Digoxin is classified as a cardiac glycoside and was initially approved by the FDA in 1954. Digoxin exerts hemodynamic, electrophysiologic, and neurohormonal effects on the cardiovascular system. It reversibly inhibits the Na-K ATPase enzyme, leading to various beneficial effects. The Na-K ATPase enzyme functions to maintain the intracellular environment by regulating the entry and exit of sodium, potassium, and calcium (indirectly). Na-K ATPase is also known as the _sodium pump_. The inhibition of the sodium pump by digoxin increases intracellular sodium and increases the calcium level in the myocardial cells, causing an increased contractile force of the heart. This improves the left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), an important measure of cardiac function. Digoxin protein binding is approximately 25%. It is mainly bound to albumin. Digoxin is a positive inotropic and negative chronotropic drug, meaning that it increases the force of the heartbeat and decreases the heart rate. The decrease in heart rate is particularly useful in cases of atrial fibrillation, a condition characterized by a fast and irregular heartbeat. The relief of heart failure symptoms during digoxin therapy has been demonstrated in clinical studies by increased exercise capacity and reduced hospitalization due to heart failure and reduced heart failure-related emergency medical visits. Digoxin has a narrow therapeutic window. Digoxin is indicated in the following conditions: 1) For the treatment of mild to moderate heart failure in adult patients. 2) To increase myocardial contraction in children diagnosed with heart failure. 3) To maintain control ventricular rate in adult patients diagnosed with chronic atrial fibrillation.\"\n",
      "Dolutegravir_(15846),\"Dolutegravir belongs to drug node. Dolutegravir is a HIV-1 intergrase inhibitor that blocks the strand transfer step of the integration of the viral genome into the host cell (INSTI). The effect of this drug has no homology in human host cells which gives it an excellent tolerability and minimal toxicity. Dolutegravir was developed by ViiV Healthcare and FDA approved on August 12, 2013. On November 21, 2017, dolutegravir, in combination with rilpivirine, was approved as part of the first complete treatment regimen with only two drugs for the treatment of adults with HIV-1 named Juluca. Dolutegravir is an HIV-1 antiviral agent. It inhibits HIV integrase by binding to the active site and blocking the strand transfer step of retroviral DNA integration in the host cell. The strand transfer step is essential in the HIV replication cycle and results in the inhibition of viral activity. Dolutegravir has a mean EC50 value of 0.5 nM (0.21 ng/mL) to 2.1 nM (0.85 ng/mL) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and MT-4 cells. Dolutegravir is highly protein bound to human plasma proteins reaching a percentage 98.9% of the administered dose. HIV-1 infected subjects on dolutegravir monotherapy demonstrated rapid and dose-dependent reduction of antiviral activity with declines of HIV-1 RNA copies per ml. The antiviral response was maintained for 3 to 4 days after the last dose. The sustained response obtained in clinical trials indicates that dolutegravir has a tight binding and longer dissociative half-life providing it a high barrier to resistance. The combination therapy (ripivirine and dolutegravir) presented the same viral suppression found in previous three-drug therapies without integrase strand transfer inhibitor mutations or rilpivirine resistance. Dolutegravir is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of patients with HIV-1 infection that comply with the characteristics of being adults or children aged 12 years and older and present at least a weight of 40 kg.

Empagliflozin is an inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2), the transporters primarily responsible for the reabsorption of glucose in the kidney. It is used clinically as an adjunct to diet and exercise, often in combination with other drug therapies, for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The vast majority of glucose filtered through the glomerulus is reabsorbed within the proximal tubule, primarily via SGLT2 (sodium-glucose linked co-transporter-2) which is responsible for ~90% of the total glucose reabsorption within the kidneys. Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase on the basolateral membrane of proximal tubular cells utilize ATP to actively pump Na+ ions into the interstitium surrounding the tubule, establishing a Na<sup>+</sup> gradient within the tubular cell. SGLT2 on the apical membrane of these cells then utilize this gradient to facilitate secondary active co-transport of both Na+ and glucose out of the filtrate, thereby reabsorbing glucose back into the blood – inhibiting this co-transport, then, allows for a marked increase in glucosuria and decrease in blood glucose levels. Empagliflozin is a potent inhibitor of renal SGLT2 transporters located in the proximal tubules of the kidneys and works to lower blood glucose levels via an increase in glucosuria. Empagliflozin is approximately 86.2% protein-bound in plasma. Empagliflozin lowers blood glucose levels by preventing glucose reabsorption in the kidneys, thereby increasing the amount of glucose excreted in the urine. It has a relatively long duration of action requiring only once-daily dosing. Patients should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis regardless of blood glucose level as empagliflozin may precipitate diabetic ketoacidosis in the absence of hyperglycemia. As its mechanism of action is contingent on the renal excretion of glucose, empagliflozin may be held in cases of acute kidney injury and/or discontinued in patients who develop chronic renal disease.  Empagliflozin is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adult patients with type 2 diabetes. It is also indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adult patients with both type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease.\"\n",
      "ATP_(15852),\"ATP belongs to drug node. An adenine nucleotide containing three phosphate groups esterified to the sugar moiety. In addition to its crucial roles in metabolism adenosine triphosphate is a neurotransmitter. ATP is able to store and transport chemical energy within cells. ATP also plays an important role in the synthesis of nucleic acids. ATP can be produced by various cellular processes, most typically in mitochondria by oxidative phosphorylation under the catalytic influence of ATP synthase. The total quantity of ATP in the human body is about 0.1 mole. The energy used by human cells requires the hydrolysis of 200 to 300 moles of ATP daily. This means that each ATP molecule is recycled 2000 to 3000 times during a single day. ATP cannot be stored, hence its consumption must closely follow its synthesis.  Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the nucleotide known in biochemistry as the \\molecular currency\\\"\" of intracellular energy transfer; that is, ATP is able to store and transport chemical energy within cells.

      "Pibrentasvir_(15864),\"Pibrentasvir belongs to drug node. Pibrentasvir is a direct acting antiviral agent and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A inhibitor that targets the the viral RNA replication and viron assembly. In combination with , pibrentastiv is a useful therapy for patients who experienced therapeutic failure from other NS5A inhibitors. In cell cultures, the emergence of amino acid substitutions at known NS5A inhibitor resistance-associated positions in HCV genotype 1a, 2a or 3a replicons led to reduced susceptibility and resistance to pibrentasvir. These resistance-associated amino acid substitutions included Q30D/deletion, Y93D/H/N or H58D +Y93H in genotype 1a replicons, F28S + M31I or P29S + K30G in genotype 2a replicons, and Y93H in genotype 3a replicons. Individual NS5A amino acid substitutions that reduced susceptibility to pibrentasvir include M28G or Q30D in a genotype 1a replicon and P32-deletion in a genotype 1b replicon.  NS5A is a phosphoprotein that plays an essential role in replication, assembly and maturation of infectious viral proteins. The basal phosphorylated form of NS5A, which is maintained by C-terminal serine cluster, is key in ensuring its interaction with the viral capsid protein, or the core protein. By blocking this interaction, pibrentasvir inhibits the assembly of proteins and production of mature HCV particles. NS5A also interacts with viral and cellular proteins to form the HCV replicase complex, and supports the RNA replication of HCV. Pibrentasvir is >99.9% bound to human plasma proteins. The Blood-to-plasma ratio is approximately 0.62. Pibrentasvir is a pan-genotypic. According to HCV replicon assays, pibrentasvir has EC50 values ranging from 0.08-4.6 nM agaisnt laboratory and clinical isolates from subtypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 4a, 4d, 5a, and 6a, or EC50 values of 0.5-4.3 pM against laboratory and clinical isolates from subtypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 4a, 4b, 4d, 5a, 6a, 6e and 6p.

      "Mesalazine_(15876),\"Mesalazine belongs to drug node. An anti-inflammatory agent, structurally related to the salicylates and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like acetylsalicylic acid, which is active in inflammatory bowel disease. It is considered to be the active moiety of sulphasalazine. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed) Although demonstrably effective in treating and maintaining remission for ulcerative colitis, mesalazine has historically faced a number of issues regarding its lack of stability as a pharmaceutical agent. Throughout the late seventies and the eighties, important research initiatives developed stable mesalazine formulations like the eudragit-S coating of Asacol brand mesalazine and the Pentasa brand's encapsulation of mesalazine within microgranules. In the present day, contemporary research regarding novel methods to stabilize mesalazine continues and interest in the agent's capacity to decrease inflammatory activity and subsequently potentially reduce the risk of colorectal cancer in conditions like ulcerative colitis is maintained. Although the mechanism of action of mesalazine is not fully understood, it is believed to possess a topical anti-inflammatory effect on colonic epithelial cells. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, is increased in patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease, and it is possible that mesalazine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon. Mesalazine is approximately 43% bound to plasma proteins ,. Mesalazine is one of the two components of sulphasalazine, the other being sulphapyridine. It is the latter which is responsible for the majority of the side effects associated with sulphasalazine therapy whilst mesalazine is known to be the active moiety in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Mesalazine is indicated for the induction of remission in patients with active or mild to moderate acute exacerbations of ulcerative colitis and for the maintece of remission of ulcerative colitis ,. Prescribing information for mesalazine in the UK also indicates the medication for the maintece of remission of Crohn's ileo-colitis.\"\n",

      "Arginine_(15912),\"Arginine belongs to drug node. An essential amino acid that is physiologically active in the L-form. Many of supplemental L-arginine's activities, including its possible anti-atherogenic actions, may be accounted for by its role as the precursor to nitric oxide or NO. NO is produced by all tissues of the body and plays very important roles in the cardiovascular system, immune system and nervous system. NO is formed from L-arginine via the enzyme nitric oxide synthase or synthetase (NOS), and the effects of NO are mainly mediated by 3,'5' -cyclic guanylate or cyclic GMP. NO activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic GMP from guanosine triphosphate or GTP. Cyclic GMP is converted to guanylic acid via the enzyme cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase. NOS is a heme-containing enzyme with some sequences similar to cytochrome P-450 reductase. Several isoforms of NOS exist, two of which are constitutive and one of which is inducible by immunological stimuli. The constitutive NOS found in the vascular endothelium is designated eNOS and that present in the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nervous system is designated nNOS. The form of NOS induced by immunological or inflammatory stimuli is known as iNOS. iNOS may be expressed constitutively in select tissues such as lung epithelium. All the nitric oxide synthases use NADPH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) and oxygen (O2) as cosubstrates, as well as the cofactors FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide), FMN (flavin mononucleotide), tetrahydrobiopterin and heme. Interestingly, ascorbic acid appears to enhance NOS activity by increasing intracellular tetrahydrobiopterin. eNOS and nNOS synthesize NO in response to an increased concentration of calcium ions or in some cases in response to calcium-independent stimuli, such as shear stress. In vitro studies of NOS indicate that the Km of the enzyme for L-arginine is in the micromolar range. The concentration of L-arginine in endothelial cells, as well as in other cells, and in plasma is in the millimolar range. What this means is that, under physiological conditions, NOS is saturated with its L-arginine substrate. In other words, L-arginine would not be expected to be rate-limiting for the enzyme, and it would not appear that supraphysiological levels of L-arginine which could occur with oral supplementation of the amino acid^would make any difference with regard to NO production. The reaction would appear to have reached its maximum level. However, in vivo studies have demonstrated that, under certain conditions, e.g. hypercholesterolemia, supplemental L-arginine could enhance endothelial-dependent vasodilation and NO production.  Studies have shown that is has improved immune responses to bacteria, viruses and tumor cells; promotes wound healing and regeneration of the liver; causes the release of growth hormones; considered crucial for optimal muscle growth and tissue repair. Used for nutritional supplementation, also for treating dietary shortage or imbalance.\"\n",
      "Minocycline_(15914),\"Minocycline belongs to drug node. Minocycline was first described in the literacture in 1966. It is a second generation tetracycline antibiotic that is active against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Like other semisynthetic tetracyclines, minocycline has modifications to carbons 7-9 on the D ring to generate higher efficacy than previous tetracyclines. Tetracyclines enter bacterial cells through OmpF and OmpC porins by coordinating with cations like magnesium. This allows tetracyclines into the periplasm where they dissociate, allowing the lipophilic tetracycline to diffuse into the bacterial cytoplasm. Tetracyclines prevent aminoacyl-tRNA from binding to the 30S ribosome, inhibiting protein synthesis.  Minocycline is 76% protein bound in serum. Minocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic that binds to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit and interferes with protein synthesis. It is generally given 2-4 times daily, so the duration of action is short. Intravenous minocycline should not exceed 400mg in 24 hours. Patients should be counselled regarding the risks related to tooth and bone development, pseudomembranous colitis, central nervous system side effects, and pseudotumor cerebri. Oral and topical minocycline are indicated to treat inflammatory lesions of acne vulgaris. Subgingival microspheres are indicated as an adjunct treatment in the reduction of pocket depth in adults with periodontitis. Oral and intravenous formulations are indicated to treat infections of susceptible microorganisms.

      "Tetrahydrofolic acid_(15954),\"Tetrahydrofolic acid belongs to drug node. Tetrahydrofolic acid is a folic acid derivative that is produced from dihydrofolic acid after conversion by dihydrofolate reductase. It is converted into 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate by serine hydroxymethyltransferase. It is a soluble coenzyme in many reactions, especially in the metabolism of amino acids and nucleic acids. Tetrahydrofolate is transported across cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis where it is needed to maintain normal erythropoiesis, synthesize purine and thymidylate nucleic acids, interconvert amino acids, methylate tRNA, and generate and use formate.  Tetrahydrofolate is the main active metabolite of dietary folate. It is vital as a coenzyme in reactions involving transfers of single carbon groups. Tetrahydrofolate has a role in nucleic and amino acid synthesis. As nucleic and amino acid synthesis is affected by a deficiency of tetrahydrofolate, actively dividing and growing cells tend to be the first affected. Tetrahydrofolate is used to treat topical sprue and megaloblastic and macrocytic anemias, hematologic complications resulting from a deficiency in folic acid.

Its activity is generally considered to lie in its metabolic breakdown product, 5-aminosalicylic acid (see mesalamine) released in the colon. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p907) The mode of action of Sulfasalazine or its metabolites, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and sulfapyridine (SP), is still under investigation, but may be related to the anti-inflammatory and/or immunomodulatory properties that have been observed in animal and <i>in vitro</i> models, to its affinity for connective tissue, and/or to the relatively high concentration it reaches in serous fluids, the liver and intestinal walls, as demonstrated in autoradiographic studies in animals. In ulcerative colitis, clinical studies utilizing rectal administration of Sulfasalazine, SP and 5-ASA have indicated that the major therapeutic action may reside in the 5-ASA moiety.

Therefore, it is possible that 5-aminosalicylic acid diminishes inflammation by blocking production of arachidonic acid metabolites in the colon through both the inhibition of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase. &ge;99% Balsalazide is a prodrug that has little or no pharmacologic activity until it is enzymatically cleaved in the colon to produce mesalamine (5-aminosalicylic acid), an anti inflammatory drug indicated for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. Balsalazide disodium is delivered intact to the colon where it is cleaved by bacterial azoreduction to release equimolar quantities of mesalamine, which is the therapeutically active portion of the molecule, and the intert 4-aminobenzoyl-(beta)-alanine. As a result, the spectrum of pharmacologic activity of balsalazide is similar to that of mesalamine. For the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis.\"\n",
      "Chlorprothixene_(16014),\"Chlorprothixene belongs to drug node. Chlorprothixene is a typical antipsychotic drug of the thioxanthene (tricyclic) class. Chlorprothixene exerts strong blocking effects by blocking the 5-HT2 D1, D2, D3, histamine H1, muscarinic and alpha1 adrenergic receptors. Chlorprothixene blocks postsynaptic mesolimbic dopaminergic D1 and D2 receptors in the brain; depresses the release of hypothalamic and hypophyseal hormones and is believed to depress the reticular activating system thus affecting basal metabolism, body temperature, wakefulness, vasomotor tone, and emesis.  Chlorprothixene is a typical antipsychotic drug of the thioxanthine class. It has a low antipsychotic potency (half to 2/3 of chlorpromazine). Chlorprothixene has not thoroughly demonstrated an antidepressant or analgesic effect but it has demonstrated antiemetic effects. It is used in the treatment of nervous, mental, and emotional conditions. Improvement in such conditions is thought to result from the effect of the medicine on nerve pathways in specific areas of the brain.

      "Amiloride_(14691),\"Amiloride belongs to drug node. A pyrazine compound inhibiting sodium reabsorption through sodium channels in renal epithelial cells. This inhibition creates a negative potential in the luminal membranes of principal cells, located in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct. Negative potential reduces secretion of potassium and hydrogen ions. Amiloride is used in conjunction with diuretics to spare potassium loss. (From Gilman et al., Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 9th ed, p705) Amiloride works by inhibiting sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts in the kidneys by binding to the amiloride-sensitive sodium channels. This promotes the loss of sodium and water from the body, but without depleting potassium. Amiloride exerts its potassium sparing effect through the inhibition of sodium reabsorption at the distal convoluted tubule, cortical collecting tubule and collecting duct; this decreases the net negative potential of the tubular lumen and reduces both potassium and hydrogen secretion and their subsequent excretion. Amiloride is not an aldosterone antagonist and its effects are seen even in the absence of aldosterone.  Amiloride, an antikaliuretic-diuretic agent, is a pyrazine-carbonyl-guanidine that is unrelated chemically to other known antikaliuretic or diuretic agents. It is an antihypertensive, potassium-sparing diuretic that was first approved for use in 1967 and helps to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure. The drug is often used in conjunction with thiazide or loop diuretics. Due to its potassium-sparing capacities, hyperkalemia (high blood potassium levels) are occasionally observed in patients taking amiloride. The risk is high in concurrent use of ACE inhibitors or spironolactone. Patients are also advised not to use potassium-containing salt replacements.

      "Lusutrombopag_(14699),\"Lusutrombopag belongs to drug node. Lusutrombopag is an orally bioavailable thrombopoietin receptor (TPOR) agonist developed by Shionogi & Company (Osaka, Japan). TPOR is a regulatory target site for endogenous thrombopoietin, which acts as a primary cytokine to promote megakaryocyte proliferation and differentiation, and affect other hematopoietic lineages as well, including erythroid, granulocytic and lymphoid lineages. Thrombocytopenia, which indicates abnormally low levels of platelets, is a common complication related to chronic liver disease. This hematological abnormality, especially in cases of severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <50,000/μL), creates challenges to patients requiring invasive medical procedures where there is a significant risk for spontaneous bleeding. Lusutrombopag binds to the transmembrane domain of TPOR expressed on megakaryocytes, and causes the proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytic progenitor cells from hematopoietic stem cells.  Lusutrombopag mimics the biological actions of endogenous thrombopoietin (TPO) by acting as an agonist for the thrombopoietin receptor (TPOR) expressed on megakaryocytes. It binds to the transmembrane domain of the receptor and induces thrombocytopoiesis by targeting the same signal transduction system as that of endogenous TPO, which involves the activation of JAK and STAT pathways. It stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow progenitor cells into megakaryocytes, which undergoes maturation to act as precursor cells for platelets. A single megakaryocyte produces and releases thousands of platelets upon maturation and series of remodeling events. Lusutrombopag displays high specificity towards human TPORs when compared to murine TPORs. Lusutrombopag may affect other hematopoietic lineages as well, including erythroid, granulocytic and lymphoid lineages. One case of increased leukocyte and erythrocyte counts that prolonged for over 120 days was reported following administration in a patient with liver cirrhosis (LC) due to hepatitis C virus.  The plasma protein binding of lusutrombopag is more than 99.9%. The AUC of lusutrombopag was found to correlate the increased platelet counts. Following administration of 3 mg daily dose in patients with chronic liver disease and thrombocytopenia, the mean (standard deviation) maximum platelet count in patients (N=74) without platelet transfusion was 86.9 (27.2) × 10^9/L, and the median time to reach the maximum platelet count was 12.0 (5 to 35) days. Lusutrombopag was not shown to induce any clinically significant QTc prolongation at a dose 8 times the recommended dosage.

      "Ranitidine_(14702),\"Ranitidine belongs to drug node. Ranitidine is a commonly used drug, classified as a histamine H2-receptor antagonist, and belongs to the same drug class as and. This drug helps to prevent and treat gastric-acid associated conditions, including ulcers, because of its ability to decrease gastric acid secretion. Ranitidine is often referred to as Zantac, and is available in various forms, including tablet, injection, and effervescent tablet preparations. After a meal, the hormone gastrin, produced by cells in the lining of the stomach, stimulates the release of histamine, which then binds to histamine H2 receptors, leading to the secretion of gastric acid. Ranitidine reduces the secretion of gastric acid by reversible binding to histamine (H2) receptors, which are found on gastric parietal cells. This process leads to the inhibition of histamine binding to this receptor, causing the reduction of gastric acid secretion. The relief of gastric-acid related symptoms can occur as soon as 60 minutes after administration of a single dose, and the effects can last from 4-10 hours, providing fast and effective symptomatic relief. The plasma protein binding of ranitidine is approximately 15%. Ranitidine decreases the secretion of gastric acid stimulated by food and drugs. It also reduces the secretion of gastric acid in hypersecretory conditions such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Marked improvements in the appearance of the esophageal tissues have been observed by endoscopic imaging after ranitidine therapy. This drug is used alone or with concomitant antacids for the following conditions: short-term treatment of active duodenal ulcer, treating gastric acid hypersecretion due to Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, systemic mastocytosis, and other conditions that may pathologically raise gastric acid levels. It also used in the short term treatment of active benign gastric ulcers and maintece therapy of gastric ulcers at a reduced dose.

Cyanocobalamin (commonly known as Vitamin B12) is a highly complex, essential vitamin, owing its name to the fact that it contains the mineral, cobalt. This vitamin is produced naturally by bacteria , and is necessary for DNA synthesis and cellular energy production. Vitamin B12 has many forms, including the cyano-, methyl-, deoxyadenosyl- and hydroxy-cobalamin forms. The _cyano_ form, is the most widely used form in supplements and prescription drugs ,. Several pharmaceutical forms of cyanocobalamin have been developed, including the tablet, injection, and nasal spray forms , ,. This drug was initially approved by the FDA in 1942. Vitamin B12 serves as a cofactor for _methionine synthase_ and _L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase_ enzymes. Methionine synthase is essential for the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines that form DNA. L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase converts L-methylmalonyl-CoA to _succinyl-CoA_ in the degradation of propionate , an important reaction required for both fat and protein metabolism. It is a lack of vitamin B12 cofactor in the above reaction and the resulting accumulation of methylmalonyl CoA that is believed to be responsible for the neurological manifestations of B12 deficiency. Succinyl-CoA is also necessary for the synthesis of hemoglobin.

It was developed by Seattle Genetics and approved by the FDA on April 17, 2020. Tucatinib is a promising new treatment for patients with metastatic breast cancer who have not responded adequately to other chemotherapy regimens. Mutations in the HER-2 gene are observed in some types of breast carcinoma. Tucatinib inhibits the tyrosine kinase enzyme of the HER-2 gene. Mutations of tyrosine kinase in the HER-2 gene lead to cascade effects of increased cell signaling and proliferation, resulting in maligcy. Results of in vitro studies show that tucatinib inhibits the phosphorylation of both HER-2 and HER-3, leading to downstream changes in MAPK and AKT signaling and cell proliferation. Anti-tumor activity occured in the cells that expressed HER-2. In vivo, tucatinib has been shown to inhibit HER-2 expressing tumors, likely by the same mechanism. Tucatinib is about 97% bound to plasma proteins. By inhibiting tyrosine kinase, tucatinib exerts anti-tumor activity, reducing the size of HER-2 positive breast cancer tumors.

      "Chenodeoxycholic acid_(14711),\"Chenodeoxycholic acid belongs to drug node. Chenodeoxycholic acid (or Chenodiol) is an epimer of ursodeoxycholic acid (DB01586). Chenodeoxycholic acid is a bile acid naturally found in the body. It works by dissolving the cholesterol that makes gallstones and inhibiting production of cholesterol in the liver and absorption in the intestines, which helps to decrease the formation of gallstones. It can also reduce the amount of other bile acids that can be harmful to liver cells when levels are elevated. Chenodiol suppresses hepatic synthesis of both cholesterol and cholic acid, gradually replacing the latter and its metabolite, deoxycholic acid in an expanded bile acid pool. These actions contribute to biliary cholesterol desaturation and gradual dissolution of radiolucent cholesterol gallstones in the presence of a gall-bladder visualized by oral cholecystography. Bile acids may also bind the the bile acid receptor (FXR) which regulates the synthesis and transport of bile acids.   It acts by reducing levels of cholesterol in the bile, helping gallstones that are made predomitly of cholesterol to dissolve. Chenodeoxycholic acid is ineffective with stones of a high calcium or bile acid content. Chenodiol is indicated for patients with radiolucent stones in well-opacifying gallbladders, in whom selective surgery would be undertaken except for the presence of increased surgical risk due to systemic disease or age. Chenodiol will not dissolve calcified (radiopaque) or radiolucent bile pigment stones.\"\n",
      "Decitabine_(14713),\"Decitabine belongs to drug node. Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of hematopoietic neoplasms with variable underlying etiology and presentation, including neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Further mutations leading to increased proliferation of cancerous cells can eventually lead to secondary acute myeloid leukemia, which has a poor prognosis. Among treatment options, nucleoside analogues such as decitabine and integrate into cellular DNA and inhibit the action of DNA methyltransferases, leading to global hypomethylation and related downstream therapeutic benefits. Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of hematopoietic neoplasms that manifest in peripheral cytopenias and may eventually progress to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML). Included in the over 45 genes commonly mutated in MDS patients are those involved in DNA methylation and histone modification, and it is well-established that alteration of the epigenetic landscape is a feature of myeloid leukemias. Decitabine exhibits negligible (< 1%) plasma protein binding. Decitabine is a prodrug analogue of the natural nucleotide 2’-deoxycytidine, which, upon being phosphorylated intracellularly, is incorporated into DNA and exerts numerous effects on gene expression. The use of decitabine is associated with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. In addition, decitabine can cause fetal harm in pregt women; effective contraception and avoidance of pregcy are recommended during treatment with decitabine. Decitabine is indicated for the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) including all French-American-British subtypes (refractory anemia, refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, refractory anemia with excess blasts, refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia), as well as for MDS scored as belonging to the intermediate-1, intermediate-2, or high-risk group in the International Prognostic Scoring System.\"\n",
      "Sofosbuvir_(14714),\"Sofosbuvir belongs to drug node. Sofosbuvir (tradename Sovaldi) is a direct acting antiviral medication used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as sofosbuvir. As a prodrug nucleotide analog, Sofosbuvir is metabolized into its active form as the antiviral agent 2'-deoxy-2'-α-fluoro-β-C-methyluridine-5'-triphosphate (also known as GS-461203), which acts as a defective substrate for NS5B (non-structural protein 5B). NS5B, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is essential for the transcription of Hepatitis C viral RNA and for its high replicative rate and genetic diversity. Sofosbuvir and other direct acting antivirals are therefore very potent options for the treatment of Hepatitis C, as they exhibit a high barrier to the development of resistance. This is an important advantage relative to HCV drugs that target other viral enzymes such as the protease, for which rapid development of resistance has proven to be an important cause of therapeutic failure.  Sofosbuvir is nucleotide analog inhibitor, which specifically inhibits HCV NS5B (non-structural protein 5B) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Following intracellular metabolism to form the pharmacologically active uridine analog triphosphate (GS-461203), sofosbuvir incorporates into HCV RNA by the NS5B polymerase and acts as a chain terminator. More specifically, Sofosbuvir prevents HCV viral replication by binding to the two Mg2+ ions present in HCV NS5B polymerase's GDD active site motif and preventing further replication of HCV genetic material. Sofosbuvir is approximately 61-65% bound to human plasma proteins. Sofosbuvir acts against HCV and is categorized as a direct-acting antiviral agent (DAA). Sofosbuvir is used in combination therapy with other antiviral medications to treat chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected patients with HCV genoptypes 1-6, and to treat HCV and HIV co-infected patients. Depending on the level of cirrhosis or decompensation, combination therapy can also include either ribavirin alone or ribavirin and peg-interferon alfa.\"\n",

      "Melatonin_(14726),\"Melatonin belongs to drug node. Melatonin is a biogenic amine that is found in animals, plants and microbes. Aaron B. Lerner of Yale University is credited for naming the hormone and for defining its chemical structure in 1958. In mammals, melatonin is produced by the pineal gland. The pineal gland is small endocrine gland, about the size of a rice grain and shaped like a pine cone (hence the name), that is located in the center of the brain (rostro-dorsal to the superior colliculus) but outside the blood-brain barrier. The secretion of melatonin increases in darkness and decreases during exposure to light, thereby regulating the circadian rhythms of several biological functions, including the sleep-wake cycle. In particular, melatonin regulates the sleep-wake cycle by chemically causing drowsiness and lowering the body temperature. Melatonin is also implicated in the regulation of mood, learning and memory, immune activity, dreaming, fertility and reproduction. Melatonin is also an effective antioxidant. Most of the actions of melatonin are mediated through the binding and activation of melatonin receptors. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may have lower than normal levels of melatonin. A 2008 study found that unaffected parents of individuals with ASD also have lower melatonin levels, and that the deficits were associated with low activity of the ASMT gene, which encodes the last enzyme of melatonin synthesis. Reduced melatonin production has also been proposed as a likely factor in the significantly higher cancer rates in night workers. Melatonin is a derivative of tryptophan. It binds to melatonin receptor type 1A, which then acts on adenylate cylcase and the inhibition of a cAMP signal transduction pathway. Melatonin not only inhibits adenylate cyclase, but it also activates phosphilpase C. This potentiates the release of arachidonate. By binding to melatonin receptors 1 and 2, the downstream signallling cascades have various effects in the body. The melatonin receptors are G protein-coupled receptors and are expressed in various tissues of the body. There are two subtypes of the receptor in humans, melatonin receptor 1 (MT1) and melatonin receptor 2 (MT2). Melatonin and melatonin receptor agonists, on market or in clinical trials, all bind to and activate both receptor types.The binding of the agonists to the receptors has been investigated for over two decades or since 1986. It is somewhat known, but still not fully understood. When melatonin receptor agonists bind to and activate their receptors it causes numerous physiological processes.  Melatonin is a hormone normally produced in the pineal gland and released into the blood. The essential amino acid L-tryptophan is a precursor in the synthesis of melatonin. It helps regulate sleep-wake cycles or the circadian rhythm. Production of melatonin is stimulated by darkness and inhibited by light. High levels of melatonin induce sleep and so consumption of the drug can be used to combat insomnia and jet lag. Used orally for jet lag, insomnia, shift-work disorder, circadian rhythm disorders in the blind (evidence for efficacy), and benzodiazepine and nicotine withdrawal. Evidence indicates that melatonin is likely effective for treating circadian rhythm sleep disorders in blind children and adults. It has received FDA orphan drug status as an oral medication for this use. A number of studies have shown that melatonin may be effective for treating sleep-wake cycle disturbances in children and adolescents with mental retardation, autism, and other central nervous system disorders. It appears to decrease the time to fall asleep in children with developmental disabilities, such as cerebral palsy, autism, and mental retardation. It may also improve secondary insomnia associated with various sleep-wake cycle disturbances. Other possible uses for which there is some evidence for include: benzodiazepine withdrawal, cluster headache, delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS), primary insomnia, jet lag, nicotine withdrawal, preoperative anxiety and sedation, prostate cancer, solid tumors (when combined with IL-2 therapy in certain cancers), sunburn prevention (topical use), tardive dyskinesia, thrombocytopenia associated with cancer, chemotherapy and other disorders. \"\n",
      "Cimetidine_(14729),\"Cimetidine belongs to drug node. A histamine congener, it competitively inhibits histamine binding to histamine H2 receptors. Cimetidine has a range of pharmacological actions. It inhibits gastric acid secretion, as well as pepsin and gastrins output. It also blocks the activity of cytochrome P-450 which might explain proposals for use in neoadjuvant therapy. Cimetidine binds to an H<sub>2</sub>-receptor located on the basolateral membrane of the gastric parietal cell, blocking histamine effects. This competitive inhibition results in reduced gastric acid secretion and a reduction in gastric volume and acidity. 15-20% Cimetidine is a histamine H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonist. It reduces basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion and a reduction in gastric volume, acidity, and amount of gastric acid released in response to stimuli including food, caffeine, insulin, betazole, or pentagastrin. It is used to treat gastrointestinal disorders such as gastric or duodenal ulcer, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and pathological hypersecretory conditions. Cimetidine inhibits many of the isoenzymes of the hepatic CYP450 enzyme system. Other actions of Cimetidine include an increase in gastric bacterial flora such as nitrate-reducing organisms.

Mibefradil is a tetralol calcium channel blocking agent that inhibits the influx of calcium ions across both the T (low-voltage) and L (high-voltage) calcium channels of cardiac and vascular smooth muscle, with a greater selectivity for T channels. Vasodilation occurs in vascular smooth muscle, causing a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance and a resulting decrease in blood pressure. Mibefradil causes a slight increase in cardiac output during chronic dosing. Mibefradil slows sinus and atrioventricular (AV) node conduction, producing a slight reduction in heart rate and a slight increase in the PR interval. It has also been shown to slightly lengthen the corrected sinus node recovery time and AH interval and to raise the Wenckebach point. The mechanism by which mibefradil reduces angina is not known, but is thought to be attributed to a reduction in heart rate, total peripheral resistance (afterload), and the heart rate&ndash;systolic blood pressure product at any given level of exercise. The result of these effects is a decrease in cardiac workload and myocardial oxygen demand. &ge; 99%, primarily to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. Mibefradil belongs to a group of medicines called calcium channel blocking agents, or, more commonly, calcium channel blockers. Calcium channel blocking agents affect the movement of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. As a result, they relax blood vessels and increase the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart while reducing its workload.

It is a highly pleiotropic molecule that exhibits antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, antioxidant, wound-healing, and antimicrobial activities. Due to these properties, curcumin has been investigated for the treatment and supportive care of clinical conditions including proteinuria, breast cancer, multiple myeloma, depression, and Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Despite proven efficacy against numerous experimental models, poor bioavailability due to poor absorption, rapid metabolism, and rapid systemic elimination have been shown to limit the therapeutic efficacy of curcumin. Curcumin is under investigation for the treatment and supportive care of various clinical conditions including mucositis, rectal cancer, prostate cancer, chronic schizophrenia, and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Curcumin acts as a scavenger of oxygen species, such as hydroxyl radical, superoxide anion, and singlet oxygen and inhibit lipid peroxidation as well as peroxide-induced DNA damage. Curcumin mediates potent anti-inflammatory agent and anti-carcinogenic actions via modulating various signalling molecules. It suppresses a number of key elements in cellular signal transduction pathways pertinent to growth, differentiation, and maligt transformation; it was demonstrated _in vitro_ that curcumin inhibits protein kinases, c-Jun/AP-1 activation, prostaglandin biosynthesis, and the activity and expression of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX)-2.

      "Lovastatin_(14135),\"Lovastatin belongs to drug node. Lovastatin, also known as the brand name product Mevacor, is a lipid-lowering drug and fungal metabolite derived synthetically from a fermentation product of _Aspergillus terreus_. Originally named Mevinolin, lovastatin belongs to the statin class of medications, which are used to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and manage abnormal lipid levels by inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as \\bad cholesterol\\\"\"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.\"\" Lovastatin is a lactone which is readily hydrolyzed _in vivo_ to the corresponding β-hydroxyacid and strong inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, a hepatic microsomal enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A ) to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. At therapeutic lovastatin doses, HMG-CoA reductase is not completely blocked, thereby allowing biologically necessary amounts of mevalonate to be available. Because the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate is an early step in the biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol, therapy with lovastatin would not be expected to cause an accumulation of potentially toxic sterols. Both lovastatin and its β-hydroxy acid metabolite are highly bound (>95%) to human plasma proteins, largely due to its lipophilicity. Animal studies demonstrated that lovastatin crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers. Lovastatin is an oral antilipemic agent which reversibly inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. It is used to lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and trigleride (TG) plasma concentrations while increasing HDL-C concentrations. High LDL-C, low HDL-C and high TG concentrations in the plasma are associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio is a strong predictor of coronary artery disease and high ratios are associated with higher risk of disease. Increased levels of HDL-C are associated with lower cardiovascular risk. By decreasing LDL-C and TG and increasing HDL-C, lovastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Lovastatin is indicated to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and the need for coronary revascularization procedures in individuals without symptomatic cardiovascular disease, average to moderately elevated total-C and LDL-C, and below average HDL-C. It is indicated as an intervention alternative in individuals presenting dyslipidemia at risk of developing atherosclerotic vascular disease.

These mental illnesses can often be accompanied by comorbidities such as depression and substance abuse, and can significantly impact the quality of life of patients and caregivers. Luckily, several treatment options for psychotic disorders have been introduced to market since the realization of chlorpromazine's antipsychotic properties in 1952.  The effects of ziprasidone are differentiated from other antispychotics based on its preference and affinity for certain receptors. Ziprasidone binds to serotonin-2A (5-HT2A) and dopamine D2 receptors in a similar fashion to other atypical antipsychotics; however, one key difference is that ziprasidone has a higher 5-HT2A/D2 receptor affinity ratio when compared to other antipsychotics such as olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole. Ziprasidone offers enhanced modulation of mood, notable negative symptom relief, overall cognitive improvement and reduced motor dysfunction which is linked to it's potent interaction with 5-HT2C, 5-HT1D, and 5-HT1A receptors in brain tissue. Ziprasidone can bind moderately to norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake sites which may contribute to its antidepressant and anxiolytic activity. Patient's taking ziprasidone will likely experience a lower incidence of orthostatic hypotension, cognitive disturbance, sedation, weight gain, and disruption in prolactin levels since ziprasidone has a lower affinity for histamine H1, muscarinic M1, and alpha1-adrenoceptors.  Ziprasidone is extensively protein bound with over 99% of the drug bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin and alpha1-acid glycoprotein. Ziprasidone is classified as a \\second generation\\\"\" or \\\"\"atypical\\\"\" antipsychotic and is a dopamine and 5HT2A receptor antagonist with a unique receptor binding profile. As previously mentioned, ziprasidone has a very high 5-HT2A/D2 affinity ratio, binds to multiple serotonin receptors in addition to 5-HT2A, and blocks monoamine transporters which prevents 5HT and NE reuptake. On the other hand, ziprasidone has a low affinity for muscarinic cholinergic M1, histamine H1, and alpha1-adrenergic receptors.\"\" In its oral form, ziprasidone is approved for the treatment of schizophrenia, as monotherapy for acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes related to bipolar I disorder, and as adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate for maintece treatment of bipolar I disorder. The injectable formulation is approved only for treatment of acute agitation in schizophrenia.\"\n",
      "Phenytoin_(14141),\"Phenytoin belongs to drug node. Phenytoin is classified as a hydantoin derivative and despite its narrow therapeutic index, it is one of the most commonly used anticonvulsants. Since it's introduction about 80 years ago, phenytoin has not only been established as an effective anti-epileptic, but has also been investigated for several other indications such as bipolar disorder, retina protection, and wound healing. Although phenytoin first appeared in the literature in 1946, it has taken decades for the mechanism of action to be more specifically elucidated. Although several scientists were convinced that phenytoin altered sodium permeability, it wasn’t until the 1980’s that this phenomenon was linked to voltage-gated sodium channels.  Phenytoin is roughly 90% protein bound. Phenytoin is an anticonvulsant with a narrow therapeutic index. Although the recommended therapeutic range is cited to be between 10-20 mg/L, differences in albumin levels, genetics, comorbidities, and body composition can make achieving an ideal phenytoin dose challenging. For example, studies have confirmed that phenytoin metabolism is impacted by CYP2C9 genotype polymorphisms and possibly by CYP2C19 genotype polymorphisms (the latter has not been as extensively studied). Phenytoin is indicated to treat grand mal seizures, complex partial seizures, and to prevent and treat seizures during or following neurosurgery. Injectable phenytoin and , which is the phosphate ester prodrug formulation of phenytoin, are indicated to treat tonic-clonic status epilepticus, and for the prevention and treatment of seizures occurring during neurosurgery.\"\n",
      "Topiramate_(14144),\"Topiramate belongs to drug node. Topiramate is a anti-epileptic drug used to manage seizures and prevent migraines. It was initially approved by the FDA in 1996. In 2004, topiramate was approved for the prevention of migraine in adults. Since 2012, the extended-release formulation has been approved in combination with for chronic weight management therapy in adults.  A seizure is an abnormal and unregulated electrical discharge occurring in the brain. This leads to transient interruption in brain function, manifested by reduced alertness, abnormal sensations, and focal involuntary movements or convulsions. Several types of seizures exist, with common types including tonic-clonic seizures and partial onset seizures. Topiramate is not highly bound to plasma proteins, with an estimated plasma protein binding of 9-17% according to some studies. The FDA label indicates that the protein binding of topiramate is 15-41%. Topiramate prevents the occurrence of seizures and prevents migraine symptoms by reducing neural pathway excitability. It is important to note that this drug may cause metabolic acidosis, mood changes, suicidal thoughts and attempts, as well as kidney stones. When topiramate is combined with , it is known to cause hypothermia. Topiramate is indicated for the following conditions: 1)Monotherapy for partial onset or primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures for patients 2 years of age and above 2)Adjunctive therapy for partial onset seizures or primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures for both adult and pediatric patients above 2 years old 3)Adjunctive therapy for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in patients above 2 years of age 4)Prophylaxis of migraine in children 12 years of age and older and adults.\"\n",
      "Morphine_(14150),\"Morphine belongs to drug node. Morphine, the main alkaloid of opium, was first obtained from poppy seeds in 1805. It is a potent analgesic, though its use is limited due to tolerance, withdrawal, and the risk of abuse. Morphine is still routinely used today, though there are a number of semi-synthetic opioids of varying strength such as , , , , , , and. Morphine-6-glucuronide is responsible for approximately 85% of the response observed by morphine administration. Morphine and its metabolites act as agonists of the mu and kappa opioid receptors. The mu-opioid receptor is integral to morphine's effects on the ventral tegmental area of the brain. Morphine's activation of the reward pathway is mediated by agonism of the delta-opioid receptor in the nucleus accumbens, while modification of the respiratory system and addiction disorder are mediated by agonism of the mu-opioid receptor. Morphine is 35% protein bound, the metabolite morphine-3-glucuronide is 10% protein bound, and morphine-6-glucuronide is 15% protein bound. Morphine binding to opioid receptors blocks transmission of nociceptive signals, signals pain-modulating neurons in the spinal cord, and inhibits primary afferent nociceptors to the dorsal horn sensory projection cells. Morphine is used for the management of chronic, moderate to severe pain.\"\n",
      "Valproic acid_(14153),\"Valproic acid belongs to drug node. Valproic acid, or valproate, is an fatty acid derivative and anticonvulsant originally synthesized in 1881 by Beverly S. Burton. It enjoyed use as a popular organic solvent in industry and pharmaceutical manufacturing for nearly a century. In 1963, a serendipitous discovery was made by George Carraz during his investigations into the anticonvulsant effects of khelline when he found that all of his samples, dissolved in valproic acid, exerted a similar degree of anticonvulsive activity. It first received approval on February 28, 1978 from the FDA under the trade name Depakene. The exact mechanisms by which valproate exerts it's effects on epilepsy, migraine headaches, and bipolar disorder are unknown however several pathways exist which may contribute to the drug's action. Protein binding is linear at low concentrations with a free fraction of approximately 10% at 40 mcg/mL but becomes non-linear at higher concentrations with a free fraction of 18.5% at 135 mcg/mL. This may be due to binding at separate high and low-affinity sites on albumin proteins. Binding is expected to decrease in the elderly and patients with hepatic dysfunction. Valproate has been shown to reduce the incidence of complex partial seizures and migraine headaches. It also improves symptom control in bipolar mania. Although the exact mechanisms responsible are unknown, it is thought that valproate produces increased cortical inhibition to contribute to control of neural synchrony. It is also thought that valproate exerts a neuroprotective effect preventing damage and neural degeneration in epilepsy, migraines, and bipolar disorder. **Indicated** for: \"\n",
      "Acetaminophen_(14154),\"Acetaminophen belongs to drug node. Acetaminophen (paracetamol), also commonly known as _Tylenol_, is the most commonly taken analgesic worldwide and is recommended as first-line therapy in pain conditions by the World Health Organization (WHO). It is also used for its antipyretic effects, helping to reduce fever. This drug was initially approved by the U.S. FDA in 1951 and is available in a variety of forms including syrup form, regular tablets, effervescent tablets, injection, suppository, and other forms. According to its FDA labeling, acetaminophen's exact mechanism of action has not been fully established - despite this, it is often categorized alongside NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) due to its ability to inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways. It is thought to exert central actions which ultimately lead to the alleviation of pain symptoms. The binding of acetaminophen to plasma proteins is low (ranging from 10% to 25%), when given at therapeutic doses. Animal and clinical studies have determined that acetaminophen has both antipyretic and analgesic effects. This drug has been shown to lack anti-inflammatory effects. As opposed to the _salicylate_ drug class, acetaminophen does not disrupt tubular secretion of uric acid and does not affect acid-base balance if taken at the recommended doses. Acetaminophen does not disrupt hemostasis and does not have inhibitory activities against platelet aggregation. Allergic reactions are rare occurrences following acetaminophen use.  In general, acetaminophen is used for the treatment of mild to moderate pain and reduction of fever. It is available over the counter in various forms, the most common being oral forms.\"\n",
      "Gefitinib_(14155),\"Gefitinib belongs to drug node. Gefitinib (originally coded ZD1839) is a drug used in the treatment of certain types of cancer. Acting in a similar manner to erlotinib (marketed as Tarceva), gefitinib selectively targets the mutant proteins in maligt cells. It is marketed by AstraZeneca under the trade name Iressa. Gefitinib is an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase that binds to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding site of the enzyme. EGFR is often shown to be overexpressed in certain human carcinoma cells, such as lung and breast cancer cells. Overexpression leads to enhanced activation of the anti-apoptotic Ras signal transduction cascades, subsequently resulting in increased survival of cancer cells and uncontrolled cell proliferation. Gefitinib is the first selective inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase which is also referred to as Her1 or ErbB-1. By inhibiting EGFR tyrosine kinase, the downstream signaling cascades are also inhibited, resulting in inhibited maligt cell proliferation.  90% primarily to serum albumin and alpha 1-acid glycoproteins (independent of drug concentrations). Gefitinib inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of numerous tyrosine kinases associated with transmembrane cell surface receptors, including the tyrosine kinases associated with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR-TK). EGFR is expressed on the cell surface of many normal cells and cancer cells. For the continued treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after failure of either platinum-based or docetaxel chemotherapies.\"\n",
      "Amitriptyline_(14156),\"Amitriptyline belongs to drug node. Amitriptyline hydrochloride, also known as _Elavil_, is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) with analgesic properties, widely used to treat depression and neuropathic pain. It was originally approved by the FDA in 1977 and manufactured by Sandoz. The mechanism of action of this drug is not fully elucidated. It is suggested that amitriptyline inhibits the membrane pump mechanism responsible for the re-uptake of transmitter amines, such as norepinephrine and serotonin, thereby increasing their concentration at the synaptic clefts of the brain ,.  These amines are important in regulating mood. The monoamine hypothesis in depression, one of the oldest hypotheses, postulates that deficiencies of serotonin (5-HT) and/or norepinephrine (NE) neurotransmission in the brain lead to depressive effects.  This drug counteracts these mechanisms, and this may be the mechanism of amitriptyline in improving depressive symptoms. Very highly protein bound (95%) in plasma and tissues. **Effects in pain and depression** This drug in indicated for the following conditions :\"\n",
      "Indomethacin_(14158),\"Indomethacin belongs to drug node. Indometacin, or indomethacin, is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties. NSAIDs consist of agents that are structurally unrelated; the NSAID chemical classification of indometacin is an indole-acetic acid derivative with the chemical name 1- (p-chlorobenzoyl)25-methoxy-2-methylindole-3-acetic acid. The pharmacological effect of indometacin is not fully understood, however, it is thought to be mediated through potent and nonselective inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), which is the main enzyme responsible for catalyzes the rate-limiting step in prostaglandin and thromboxane biosynthesis via the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway. Indometacin was first discovered in 1963 and it was first approved for use in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration in 1965, along with other acetic acid derivatives such as and that were also developed during the 1960s. Since then, indometacin has been extensively studied in clinical trials as one of the most potent NSAIDs in blocking prostaglandin synthesis and was among the first NSAIDs to be used in the symptomatic treatment of migraine and for headaches that eventually became known as “indomethacin-responsive” headache disorders.  Indometacin is a nonspecific and reversible inhibitor of the cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzyme, or prostaglandin G/H synthase. There are two identified isoforms of COX: COX-1 is universally present in most body tissues and is involved in the synthesis of the prostaglandins and thromboxane A2, while COX-2 is expressed in response to injury or inflammation. Constitutively expressed, the COX-1 enzyme is involved in gastric mucosal protection, platelet, and kidney function by catalyzing the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin (PG) G2 and PGG2 to PGH2. COX-2 is constitutively expressed and highly inducible by inflammatory stimuli. It is found in the central nervous system, kidneys, uterus, and other organs. COX-2 also catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to PGG2 and PGG2 to PGH2. In the COX-2-mediated pathway, PGH2 is further converted to PGE2 and PGI2 (also known as prostacyclin). PGE2 is involved in mediating inflammation, pain, and fever. Decreasing levels of PGE2 leads to reduced inflammatory reactions. Indometacin is known to inhibit both isoforms of COX, however, with greater selectivity for COX-1, which accounts for its increased adverse gastric effects relative to other NSAIDs. It binds to the active site of the enzyme and prevents the interaction between the enzyme and its substrate, arachidonic acid. Indometacin, unlike other NSAIDs, also inhibits phospholipase A2, the enzyme responsible for releasing arachidonic acid from phospholipids. The analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects of indomethacin as well as adverse reactions associated with the drug occur as a result of decreased prostaglandin synthesis. Its antipyretic effects may be due to action on the hypothalamus, resulting in increased peripheral blood flow, vasodilation, and subsequent heat dissipation. Indometacin is a weak organic acid that is 90-99% bound to protein in plasma over the expected range of therapeutic plasma concentrations. Like other NSAIDs, indometacin is bound to plasma albumin but it does not bind to red blood cells.  Indometacin is an NSAID with analgesic and antipyretic properties that exerts its pharmacological effects by inhibiting the synthesis of factors involved in pain, fever, and inflammation. Its therapeutic action does not involve pituitary-adrenal stimulation. Indometacin primarily works by suppressing inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis by providing relief of pain as well as reducing fever, swelling, and tenderness. This effectiveness has been demonstrated by a reduction in the extent of joint swelling, the average number of joints displaying symptoms of inflammation, and the severity of morning stiffness. Increased mobility was demonstrated by a decrease in total walking time and by improved functional capability seen as an increase in grip strength. In clinical trials, indometacin was shown to be effective in relieving the pain, reducing the fever, swelling, redness, and tenderness of acute gouty arthritis. Due to its pharmacological actions, the use of indometacin is associated with the risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke, as well as gastrointestinal effects such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines. Oral indometacin is indicated for symptomatic management of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis including acute flares of chronic disease, moderate to severe ankylosing spondylitis, moderate to severe osteoarthritis, acute painful shoulder (bursitis and/or tendinitis) and acute gouty arthritis.\"\n",
      "Ipratropium_(14159),\"Ipratropium belongs to drug node. Ipratropium is a quaternary ammonium derivative of that acts as an anticholinergic agent. It is commonly administered through inhalation which allows producing a local effect without presenting a significant systemic absorption. Ipratropium acts as an antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. This effect produces the inhibition of the parasympathetic nervous system in the airways and hence, inhibit their function. The function of the parasympathetic system in the airway is to generate bronchial secretions and constriction and hence, the inhibition of this action can lead to bronchodilation and fewer secretions. The protein binding of ipratropium is very low as the level of circulating ipratropium is very minimal. The bound state represents only from 0-9% of the administered dose. Ipratropium is a short-acting agent that inhibits the parasympathetic nervous system at the level of the airway which then produces bronchodilatation. The effect of this agent starts after 1-2 hours and it is known to last only from 4 to 6 hours. As part of the effect, ipratropium relaxes the bronchial airways which reverse the narrowing that accounts for wheezy breathing, chest tightness, cough and abnormal gas exchange. Inhaled ipratropium is indicated in combination with inhaled beta-agonist systemic corticosteroids for the management of severe exacerbations of asthma flares requiring treatment.\"\n",
      "Methadone_(14160),\"Methadone belongs to drug node. Methadone is a potent synthetic analgesic that works as a full µ-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. As a full MOR agonist, methadone mimics the natural effects of the body's opioids, endorphins, and enkephalins through the release of neurotransmitters involved in pain transmission. It also has a number of unique characteristics that have led to its increased use in the last two decades; in particular, methadone has a lower risk of neuropsychiatric toxicity compared to other opioids (due to a lack of active metabolites), minimal accumulation in renal failure, good bioavailability, low cost, and a long duration of action.  Methadone is a synthetic opioid analgesic with full agonist activity at the µ-opioid receptor. While agonism of the µ-opioid receptor is the primary mechanism of action for the treatment of pain, methadone also acts as an agonist of κ- and σ-opioid receptors within the central and peripheral nervous systems. Interestingly, methadone differs from (which is considered the gold standard reference opioid) in its antagonism of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and its strong inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine uptake, which likely also contributes to its antinociceptive activity.  Methadone is highly bound to plasma proteins. While it primarily binds to α1-acid glycoprotein (85-90%), it also binds to albumin and other tissue and plasma proteins including lipoproteins. Methadone is unusual in the opioid class, in that there is extensive binding to tissue proteins and fairly slow transfer between some parts of this tissue reservoir and the plasma. Overall, methadone's pharmacological actions result in analgesia, suppression of opioid withdrawal symptoms, sedation, miosis (through binding to receptors in the pupillary muscles), sweating, hypotension, bradycardia, nausea and vomiting (via binding within the chemoreceptor trigger zone), and constipation. Like many basic drugs, methadone also enters mast cells and releases histamine by a non-immunological mechanism leading to flushing, pruritus, and urticaria, which can commonly be misattributed to an allergic reaction.  Methadone is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. It's recommended that use is reserved for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (eg, nonopioid analgesics, opioid combination products) are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain.\"\n",
      "Olanzapine_(14161),\"Olanzapine belongs to drug node. Olanzapine is a thienobenzodiazepine classified as an atypical or second-generation antipsychotic agent. The second-generation antipsychotics were introduced in the 90s and quickly gained traction due to their impressive efficacy, reduced risk for extrapyramidal side effects and reduced susceptibility to drug-drug interactions. Olanzapine very closely resembles and only differs by two additional methyl groups and the absence of a chloride moiety. It was discovered by scientists at Eli Lilly and approved to be marketed in the US in 1996. The activity of olanzapine is achieved by the antagonism of multiple neuronal receptors including the dopamine receptor D1, D2, D3 and D4 in the brain, the serotonin receptors 5HT2A, 5HT2C, 5HT3 and 5HT6, the alpha-1 adrenergic receptor, the histamine receptor H1 and multiple muscarinic receptors. Olanzapine is largely bound to plasma proteins and hence, about 93% of the administered dose is bound. The main proteins for binding are albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. The effect of olanzapine in the D2 receptor is reported to produce the positive effects of this drug such as a decrease in hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, disorganized thought, and disorganized behavior. On the other hand, its effect on the serotonin 5HT2A receptor prevents the onset of anhedonia, flat affect, alogia, avolition and poor attention. Based on the specific mechanism of action, olanzapine presents a higher affinity for the dopamine D2 receptor when compared to the rest of the dopamine receptor isotypes. This characteristic significantly reduces the presence of side effects. Olanzapine was initially used orally and intramuscularly for the chronic treatment of schizophrenia in patients over 13 years old and other psychiatric disorders such as bipolar I disorder including mixed or manic episodes. \"\n",
      "Diltiazem_(14163),\"Diltiazem belongs to drug node. Diltiazem is a benzothiazepine derivative with antihypertensive and vasodilating properties. Approved in 1982 by the FDA, it is a member of the non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers drug class. It works through various mechanisms of action, but it primarily works by inhibiting the calcium influx into cardiac and vascular smooth muscle during depolarization. Compared to dihydropyridine drugs, such as , that preferentially act on vascular smooth muscle and that directly acts on the heart muscle, diltiazem displays an intermediate specificity to target both the cardiac and vascular smooth muscle. Being a potent vasodilator, diltiazem is used clinically as an antihypertensive, anti-arrhythmic, and as an anti-anginal agent for the management of cardiovascular conditions such as hypertension, chronic stable angina, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter. Apart from its main FDA-approved indications, diltiazem has also been used for numerous off-label indications, such as anal fissures (in topical formulations), migraine prophylaxis, pulmonary hypertension, and rest-related cramps in the lower extremities. Typically available in extended-release oral and intravenous formulations, diltiazem is marketed under various brand names with Cardizem and Tiazac being the most common ones. Excitation of cardiac muscle involves the activation of a slow calcium inward current that is induced by L-type slow calcium channels, which are voltage-sensitive, ion-selective channels associated with a high activation threshold and slow inactivation profile. L-type calcium channels are the main current responsible for the late phase of the pacemaker potential. Acting as the main Ca2+ source for contraction in smooth and cardiac muscle, activation of L-type calcium channels allows the influx of calcium ions into the muscles upon depolarization and excitation of the channel. It is proposed that this cation influx may also trigger the release of additional calcium ions from intracellular storage sites. Diltiazem is a slow calcium channel blocker that binds to the extracellular site of the alpha-1C subunit of the channel, which is thought to be the S5-6 linker region of the transmembrane domain IV and/or S6 segment of domain III. Diltiazem can get access to this binding site from either the intracellular or extracellular side, but it requires a voltage-induced conformational changes in the membrane. Diltiazem inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes. In isolated human atrial and ventricular myocardium, diltiazem suppressed tension over the range of membrane potentials associated with calcium channel activity but had little effect on the tension-voltage relations at more positive potentials. This effect is thought to be mediated by the voltage-dependent block of the L-type calcium channels and inhibition of calcium ion release from the ER stores, without altering the sodium-calcium coupled transport or calcium sensitivity of myofilaments. Through inhibition of inward calcium current, diltiazem exerts a direct ionotropic and energy sparing effect on the myocardium. Diltiazem fslows atrioventricular nodal conduction, which is due to its ability to impede slow channel function. Diltiazem is about 70-80% bound to plasma proteins, according to _in vitro_ binding studies. About 40% of the drug is thought to bind to alpha-1-glycoprotein at clinically significant concentrations while about 30% of the drug is bound to albumin. Diltiazem is an antihypertensive and vasodilating agent that works by relaxing the vascular muscle and reducing blood pressure. This is related to the long-term therapeutic effects, as lowering the blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. Diltiazem inhibits the influx of extracellular calcium ions across the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes during depolarization. Diltiazem is classified as a negative inotrope (decreased force) and negative chronotrope (decreased rate). It is also considered a rate-control drug as it reduces heart rate. Diltiazem is exerts hemodynamic actions by reducing blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance, the rate-pressure product, and coronary vascular resistance while increasing coronary blood flow. Diltiazem decreases sinoatrial and atrioventricular conduction in isolated tissues and has a negative inotropic effect in isolated preparations. In supraventricular tachycardia, diltiazem prolongs AV nodal refractories. **Oral**\"\n",
      "Rosiglitazone_(14165),\"Rosiglitazone belongs to drug node. Rosiglitazone is an anti-diabetic drug in the thiazolidinedione class of drugs. It is marketed by the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline as a stand-alone drug (Avandia) and in combination with metformin (Avandamet) or with glimepiride (Avandaryl). Like other thiazolidinediones, the mechanism of action of rosiglitazone is by activation of the intracellular receptor class of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), specifically PPARγ. Rosiglitazone is a selective ligand of PPARγ, and has no PPARα-binding action. Apart from its effect on insulin resistance, it appears to have an anti-inflammatory effect: nuclear factor kappa-B (NFκB) levels fall and inhibitor (IκB) levels increase in patients on rosiglitazone. Recent research has suggested that rosiglitazone may also be of benefit to a subset of patients with Alzheimer's disease not expressing the ApoE4 allele. This is the subject of a clinical trial currently underway. Rosiglitazone acts as a highly selective and potent agonist at peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR) in target tissues for insulin action such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. Activation of PPAR-gamma receptors regulates the transcription of insulin-responsive genes involved in the control of glucose production, transport, and utilization. In this way, rosiglitazone enhances tissue sensitivity to insulin. 99.8% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. When rosiglitazone is used as monotherapy, it is associated with increases in total cholesterol, LDL, and HDL. It is also associated with decreases in free fatty acids. Increases in LDL occurred primarily during the first 1 to 2 months of therapy with AVANDIA and LDL levels remained elevated above baseline throughout the trials. In contrast, HDL continued to rise over time. As a result, the LDL/HDL ratio peaked after 2 months of therapy and then appeared to decrease over time.  Rosiglitazone is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. \"\n",
      "Ampicillin_(14167),\"Ampicillin belongs to drug node. Ampicillin is a semi-synthetic derivative of penicillin that functions as an orally active broad-spectrum antibiotic. By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, Ampicillin inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that Ampicillin interferes with an autolysin inhibitor.  Ampicillin is a penicillin beta-lactam antibiotic used in the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible, usually gram-positive, organisms.

Bone resorption by osteoclasts causes local acidification, releasing the bisphosphonate, which is taken into the osteoclast by fluid-phase endocytosis. Endocytic vesicles become acidified, releasing bisphosphonates into the cytosol of osteoclasts where they act. Pamidronate is approximately 54% protein bound in serum. Pamidronic acid is a second generation, nitrogen containing bisphosphonate that inhibits osteoclast mediated bone loss It has a wide therapeutic index and a long duration of action as it can be given every 3-4 weeks for certain indications. Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of elevated blood urea nitrogen, renal tubular necrosis, and nephrotoxicity. Pamidronate is indicated to treat moderate to severe hypercalcemia of maligcy, moderate to severe Paget's disease of bone, osteolytic bone metastases of breast cancer, and osteolytic lesions of multiple myeloma.\"\n",

The only marketed drug containing tetraethylammonium was a combination drug called Fosglutamina B6, but this drug has now been discontinued. As an experimental agent, tetraethylammonium is used in its salt forms such as tetraethylammonium chloride and tetraethylammonium bromide. Its mechanism of action is still being investigated, but it is known that tetraethylammonium blocks autonomic ganglia, calcium- and voltage- activated potassium channels, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Because of its inhibitory actions at the autonomic ganglia, tetraethylammonium was thought to be a potential therapeutic vasodilator but serious toxic effects were found. The most common use of tetraethylammonium presently is as a pharmacological research agent that blocks selective potassium channels. Structurally, tetraethylammonium is positively charged due to its central quaternary ammonium. Tetraethylammonium's mechanism of action is still being investigated, but it is known that it blocks autonomic ganglia, calcium- and voltage- activated potassium channels, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.

      "Deoxycholic acid_(17797),\"Deoxycholic acid belongs to drug node. Deoxycholic acid is a a bile acid which emulsifies and solubilizes dietary fats in the intestine, and when injected subcutaneously, it disrupts cell membranes in adipocytes and destroys fat cells in that tissue. In April 2015, deoxycholic acid was approved by the FDA for the treatment submental fat to improve aesthetic appearance and reduce facial fullness or convexity. It is marketed under the brand name Kybella by Kythera Biopharma and is the first pharmacological agent available for submental fat reduction, allowing for a safer and less invasive alternative than surgical procedures. As a bile acid, deoxycholic acid emulsifies fat in the gut. Synthetically derived deoxycholic acid, when injected, stimulates a targeted breakdown of adipose cells by disrupting the cell membrane and causing adipocytolysis. This results in an inflammatory reaction and clearing of the adipose tissue remts by macrophages. Deoxycholic acid's actions are reduced by albumin and tissue-associated proteins, therefore its effect is limited to protein-poor subcutaneous fat tissue. Protein-rich tissues like muscle and skin are unaffected by deoxycholic acid, contributing to its safety profile.  98%  For improvement in appearance of moderate to severe fullness associated with submental fat in adults. \"\n",

Olsalazine is a derivative of salicylic acid. Inactive by itself (it is a prodrug), it is converted by the bacteria in the colon to mesalamine. Mesalamine works as an anti-inflammatory agent in treating inflammatory diseases of the intestines. Orally administered olsalazine is converted to mesalamine which is thought to be the therapeutically active agent in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. The mechanism of action of mesalamine (and sulfasalazine) is unknown, but appears to be topical rather than systemic. Mucosal production of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase pathways, i.e., prostanoids, and through the lipoxygenase pathways, i.e., leukotrienes (LTs) and hydroxyelcosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) is increased in patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin (PG) production in the colon. Olsalazine and olsalazine-S are more than 99% bound to plasma proteins. Mesalamine (5-ASA) is 74% bound to plasma proteins. Olsalazine is an anti-inflammatory drug used in the treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. Olsalazine reduces the bowel inflammation, diarrhea (stool frequency), rectal bleeding, and abdominal pain.

      "Levetiracetam_(18277),\"Levetiracetam belongs to drug node. Levetiracetam is a drug within the pyrrolidine class that is used to treat various types of seizures stemming from epileptic disorders. It was first approved for use in the United States in 1999 and is structurally and mechanistically unrelated to other anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). Levetiracetam possesses a wide therapeutic index and little-to-no potential to produce, or be subject to, pharmacokinetic interactions - these characteristics make it a desirable choice over other AEDs, a class of drugs notorious for having generally narrow therapeutic indexes and a propensity for involvement in drug interactions. The exact mechanism through which levetiracetam exerts its anti-epileptic effects is unclear, but is thought to be unique amongst other anti-epileptic medications. Current knowledge suggests that levetiracetam’s binding to synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) is a key driver of its action. SV2A is a membrane-bound protein that is found on synaptic vesicles and is ubiquitous throughout the CNS - it appears to play a role in vesicle exocytosis and in the modulation of synaptic transmission by increasing the available amount of secretory vesicles available for neurotransmission. Stimulation of pre-synaptic SV2A by levetiracetam may inhibit neurotransmitter release, but this action does not appear to affect normal neurotransmission. This has led to the suggestion that levetiracetam exclusively modulates the function of SV2A only under pathophysiological conditions. Levetiracetam and related analogues showed a correlation between affinity for SV2A and anti-epileptic potency, further suggesting that action at this site contributes to the anti-epileptic activity of the drug. Levetiracetam and its metabolites are largely unbound to plasma proteins (<10%). Levetiracetam appears to prevent seizure activity via the selective inhibition of hypersynchronized epileptiform burst firing without affecting normal neuronal transmission, though the exact mechanism through which this occurs is unclear. The therapeutic index of levetiracetam is wide, making it relatively unique amongst other anti-epileptic medications. Levetiracetam is indicated as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures in epileptic patients who are one month of age and older. Additionally, it is indicated as an adjunct in the treatment of myoclonic seizures in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy who are 12 years of age and older, and in primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy who are 6 years of age and older.\"\n",

The radioisotope, technetium-99m, is chelated by two 1,2-bisethane ligands which belong to the group of diphosphines and which are referred to as tetrofosmin. It is a lipophilic technetium phosphine dioxo cation that was formulated into a freeze-dried kit which yields an injection. Technetium Tc-99m tetrofosmin was developed by GE Healthcare and FDA approved on February 9, 1996. The mechanism for the uptake and retention of technetium-99m tetrofosmin is not well established. Nonetheless, it is known that technetium 99m tetrofosmin binds to the intracellular cytosol of myocytes. This uptake is thought to be because technetium-99m tetrofosmin is a lipophilic cationic agent which allows it to present a passive diffusion process. Once the uptake is done, the technetium-99m accumulates in viable myocardial tissue delineating the infarcts areas when administered at rest and delineating the ischemic areas when administered at stress. The protein binding of technetium-99m tetrofosmin has not been assessed, but it is thought that the uptake of this drug may be related to its binding to P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance proteins. Preclinical studies have reported that technetium-99m tetrofosmin presents a very good heart uptake and retention. The diagnosis based on the presence of technetium-99m is considered to have a principal photon gamma emissions at 140.5 keV. The imaging can be done at 15 minutes after stress and 30-60 minutes at rest but, due to its slow wash out from myocardium, it is possible to perform imaging for up to 4 hours post-injection. Administration of technetium-99m tetrofosmin generates a count elevation in white blood cell at 6-24 hours post-injection.  Technetium-99m tetrofosmin is indicated for the diagnosis of heart abnormalities by exercise myocardial scintigraphy. The exercise myocardial scintigraphy is an established method for the diagnosis of the severity of coronary artery disease. This method allows distinguishing regions of reversible myocardial ischemia in the presence or absence of infarcted myocardium following rest and stress conditions. The use of technetium-99m tetrofosmin is mainly used to assess myocardial perfusion in ischemia and infarction.\"\n",
      "alpha-Linolenic acid_(14572),\"alpha-Linolenic acid belongs to drug node. Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is a polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acid. It is a component of many common vegetable oils and is important to human nutrition. Alpha Linolenic Acid or ALA is considered an essential fatty acid because it is required for human health, but cannot be synthesized by humans. It is in fact a plant-derived fatty acid. Humans can synthesize other omega-3 fatty acids from ALA, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). EPA is a precursor of the series-3 prostaglandins, the series-5 leukotrienes and the series-3 thromboxanes. These eicosanoids have anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic properties. ALA metabolites may also inhibit the production of the pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4), as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). Omega-3 fatty acids like ALA and its byproducts can modulate the expression of a number of genes, including those involved with fatty acid metabolism and inflammation. They regulate gene expression through their effects on the activity of transcription factors including NF-kappa B and members of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) family. Incorporation of ALA and its metabolites in cell membranes can affect membrane fluidity and may play a role in anti-inflammatory activity, inhibition of platelet aggregation and possibly in anti-proliferative actions of ALA. ALA is first metabolized by delta6 desaturease into steridonic acid.  Alpha Linolenic Acid (ALA) is an 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acid with three double bonds. It is also called an omega-3 fatty acid, and is essential for all mammals. Alpha-linolenic acid (or omega 3 fatty acid) intake can decrease the risk of cardiovascular diseases by 1) preventing arrhythmias that can lead to sudden cardiac death, 2) decreasing the risk of thrombosis (blood clot formation) that can lead to heart attack or stroke, 3) decreasing serum triglyceride levels, 4) slowing the growth of atherosclerotic plaque, 5) improving vascular endothelial function, 6) lowering blood pressure slightly, and 7) decreasing inflammation.

      "Nadolol_(14582),\"Nadolol belongs to drug node. Nadolol is a nonselective beta adrenal receptor blocker that is used to lower blood pressure. Nonselective beta adrenal receptor blockers may no longer be first line in the treatment of hypertension as newer generations of beta adrenal receptor blockers have higher selectivity and offer better rates of adverse effects. Although nadolol is described as a non selective beta blocker, it does not interact with beta 3 adrenal receptors. Antagonism of beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors in the heart inhibits cyclic AMP and its signalling pathway, decreasing the strength and speed of contractions as well as the speed of relaxation and conduction. Antagonism of beta-2 adrenoceptors in the smooth muscle cells of the vasculature inhibits their relaxation, leading to an increase in peripheral vascular resistance and reducing the risk of severe hypotension. The increase in peripheral vascular resistance may contribute to the decrease in insulin sensitivity associated with nadolol use. Antagonism of beta-1 adrenoceptors in the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidney inhibits the release of renin, and therefore angiotensin II mediated vasoconstriction, aldosterone mediated water retention, and the release of epinephrine. Antagonism of beta-2 adrenoceptors in the liver and skeletal muscle inhibits glycogenolysis, in the lungs prevents bronchodilation, and in the pancrease inhibits insulin release. Nadolol is approximately 30% bound to plasma protein. Nadolol binds to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein in plasma. Nadolol is a nonselective beta adrenal receptor blocker that is used to lower blood pressure. It has a long duration of action as it is usually taken once daily and a wide therapeutic index as patients start at doses of 40mg daily but may be increased to doses as high as 240mg daily.

Sphingosine‐1‐phosphate (S1P) is an important phospholipid that binds to various G‐protein‐coupled receptor subtypes, which can be identified as S1P1–5R. S1P and the receptors it binds to perform regular functions in the immune, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and nervous system. S1P can be expressed ubiquitously, playing an important role in regulating inflammation. S1P1R, S1P2R, and S1P3R receptors can be found in the cardiovascular, immune, and central nervous systems. S1P4R is found on lymphocytic and hematopoietic cells, while S1P5R expression is found only on the spleen (on natural killer cells) or in the central nervous system. The plasma protein binding of ozanimod and its metabolites exceeds 98%. Ozanimod reduces circulating lymphocytes that cause the neuroinflammation associated with MS, reducing debilitating symptoms and, possibly, disease progression. During clinical trials, ozanimod reduced MS-associated brain volume loss in several regions.

Eletriptan binds with high affinity to 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D and 5-HT1F receptors, has modest affinity for 5-HT1A, 5-HT1E, 5-HT2B and 5-HT7 receptors, and little or no affinity for 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HT5A and 5-HT6 receptors. In contrast, eletriptan displays insignificant pharmacological activity at adrenergic alpha1, alpha2, or beta; dopaminergic D1 or D2; muscarinic; or opioid receptors. While the full mechanism of action of 5-HT receptor agonists in relieving migrains is not fully elucidated, it is proposed that the activation of 5-HT1 receptors located on intracranial blood vessels leads to vasoconstriction that correlates with the relief of migraine headaches. It is also proposed that the activation of 5-HT1 receptors on sensory nerve endings in the trigeminal system leads to the inhibition of release of pro-inflammatory neuropeptides.  Plasma protein binding is moderate and approximately 85%. Eletriptan is a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B/1D receptor agonist. In the anesthetized dog, eletriptan has been shown to reduce carotid arterial blood flow, with only a small increase in arterial blood pressure at high doses.

      "Etoposide_(14604),\"Etoposide belongs to drug node. A semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin that exhibits antitumor activity. Etoposide inhibits DNA synthesis by forming a complex with topoisomerase II and DNA. This complex induces breaks in double stranded DNA and prevents repair by topoisomerase II binding. Accumulated breaks in DNA prevent entry into the mitotic phase of cell division, and lead to cell death. Etoposide acts primarily in the G2 and S phases of the cell cycle. Etoposide inhibits DNA topoisomerase II, thereby inhibiting DNA re-ligation. This causes critical errors in DNA synthesis at the premitotic stage of cell division and can lead to apoptosis of the cancer cell. Etoposide is cell cycle dependent and phase specific, affecting mainly the S and G2 phases of cell division. Inhibition of the topoisomerase II alpha isoform results in the anti-tumour activity of etoposide. The drug is also capable of inhibiting the beta isoform but inhibition of this target is not associated with the anti-tumour activity. It is instead associated with the carcinogenic effect.  97% protein bound.  Etoposide is an antineoplastic agent and an epipodophyllotoxin (a semisynthetic derivative of the podophyllotoxins). It inhibits DNA topoisomerase II, thereby ultimately inhibiting DNA synthesis. Etoposide is cell cycle dependent and phase specific, affecting mainly the S and G2 phases. Two different dose-dependent responses are seen. At high concentrations (10 &micro;g/mL or more), lysis of cells entering mitosis is observed. At low concentrations (0.3 to 10 &micro;g/mL), cells are inhibited from entering prophase. It does not interfere with microtubular assembly. The predomit macromolecular effect of etoposide appears to be the induction of DNA strand breaks by an interaction with DNA-topoisomerase II or the formation of free radicals.

It is administered orally as the prodrug, candesartan cilexetil, which is rapidly converted to its active metabolite, candesartan, during absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Candesartan lowers blood pressure by antagonizing the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS); it competes with angiotensin II for binding to the type-1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1) subtype and prevents the blood pressure increasing effects of angiotensin II. Unlike angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, ARBs do not have the adverse effect of dry cough. Candesartan may be used to treat hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy and diabetic nephropathy. It may also be used as an alternative agent for the treatment of heart failure, systolic dysfunction, myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease. Candesartan selectively blocks the binding of angiotensin II to AT1 in many tissues including vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal glands. This inhibits the AT1-mediated vasoconstrictive and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II and results in an overall decrease in blood pressure. Candesartan is greater than 10,000 times more selective for AT1 than AT2. Inhibition of aldosterone secretion may increase sodium and water excretion while decreasing potassium excretion. Candesartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (>99%) and does not penetrate red blood cells. Candesartan cilexetil is an ARB prodrug that is rapidly converted to candesartan, its active metabolite, during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Candesartan confers blood pressure lowering effects by antagonizing the hypertensive effects of angiotensin II via the RAAS. RAAS is a homeostatic mechanism for regulating hemodynamics, water and electrolyte balance. During sympathetic stimulation or when renal blood pressure or blood flow is reduced, renin is released from granular cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys. Renin cleaves circulating angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is cleaved by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II increases blood pressure by increasing total peripheral resistance, increasing sodium and water reabsorption in the kidneys via aldosterone secretion, and altering cardiovascular structure. Angiotensin II binds to two receptors: type-1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1) and type-2 angiotensin II receptor (AT2). AT1 is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that mediates the vasoconstrictive and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II. Studies performed in recent years suggest that AT2 antagonizes AT1-mediated effects and directly affects long-term blood pressure control by inducing vasorelaxation and increasing urinary sodium excretion. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are non-peptide competitive inhibitors of AT1. ARBs block the ability of angiotensin II to stimulate pressor and cell proliferative effects. Unlike ACE inhibitors, ARBs do not affect bradykinin-induced vasodilation. The overall effect of ARBs is a decrease in blood pressure. May be used as a first line agent to treat uncomplicated hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. May be used as a first line agent to delay progression of diabetic nephropathy. Candesartan may be also used as a second line agent in the treatment of congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction, myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease in those intolerant of ACE inhibitors.\"\n",
      "Thalidomide_(14606),\"Thalidomide belongs to drug node. A piperidinyl isoindole originally introduced as a non-barbiturate hypnotic, but withdrawn from the market due to teratogenic effects. It has been reintroduced and used for a number of immunological and inflammatory disorders. Thalidomide displays immunosuppresive and anti-angiogenic activity. It inhibits release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha from monocytes, and modulates other cytokine action.  In patients with erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) the mechanism of action is not fully understood. Available data from in vitro studies and preliminary clinical trials suggest that the immunologic effects of this compound can vary substantially under different conditions, but may be related to suppression of excessive tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) production and down-modulation of selected cell surface adhesion molecules involved in leukocyte migration. For example, administration of thalidomide has been reported to decrease circulating levels of TNF-a in patients with ENL, however, it has also been shown to increase plasma TNF-a levels in HIV-seropositive patients. As a cancer treatment, the drug may act as a VEGF inhibitor. 55% and 66% for the (+)R and (&minus;)S etiomers, respectively. Thalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent with a spectrum of activity that is not fully characterized. Thalidomide is racemic &mdash; it contains both left and right handed isomers in equal amounts: one etiomer is effective against morning sickness, and the other is teratogenic. The etiomers are converted to each other in vivo. That is, if a human is given D-thalidomide or L-thalidomide, both isomers can be found in the serum. Hence, administering only one etiomer will not prevent the teratogenic effect in humans. For the acute treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). Also for use as maintece therapy for prevention and suppression of the cutaneous manifestations of ENL recurrence.\"\n",
      "Diphenhydramine_(14607),\"Diphenhydramine belongs to drug node. Diphenhydramine - perhaps known most commonly as its brand name formulation Benadryl - is a first-generation H1 receptor antihistamine that is used extensively for the treatment of seasonal allergies, insect bites and stings, and rashes. However, it also has antiemetic, antitussive, hypnotic, and antiparkinson properties. As histamine receptors exist both peripherally and in the central nervous system, diphenhydramine has been shown to cause sedation due to its competitive antagonism of histamine H1 receptors within the central nervous system. While its use in allergy therapy can sometimes fall out of favor due to its sedative effect, diphenhydramine has been repurposed for use within many non-prescription over-the-counter sleep aids and cough-and-cold medications that have been marketed for \\night time\\\"\" use. \"\" Diphenhydramine predomitly works via the antagonism of H1 (Histamine 1) receptors. Such H1 receptors are located on respiratory smooth muscles, vascular endothelial cells, the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), cardiac tissue, immune cells, the uterus, and the central nervous system (CNS) neurons. When the H1 receptor is stimulated in these tissues it produces a variety of actions including increased vascular permeability, promotion of vasodilation causing flushing, decreased atrioventricular (AV) node conduction time, stimulation of sensory nerves of airways producing coughing, smooth muscle contraction of bronchi and the GIT, and eosinophilic chemotaxis that promotes the allergic immune response. Some prescribing information records the protein binding of diphenhydramine as approximately 78% while others have suggested the medication is about 80 to 85% bound to plasma proteins. Diphenhydramine has anti-histaminic (H1-receptor), anti-emetic, anti-vertigo and sedative and hypnotic properties. The anti-histamine action occurs by blocking the spasmogenic and congestive effects of histamine by competing with histamine for H1 receptor sites on effector cells, preventing but not reversing responses mediated by histamine alone. Such receptor sites may be found in the gut, uterus, large blood vessels, bronchial muscles, and elsewhere. Anti-emetic action is by inhibition at the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone. Anti-vertigo action is by a central antimuscarinic effect on the vestibular apparatus and the integrative vomiting center and medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone of the midbrain. Diphenhydramine is a first-generation histamine H1 receptor antagonist (H1 antihistamine) that is widely available as a non-prescription, over-the-counter (OTC) medication. As an OTC medication, diphenhydramine is typically formulated as tablets and creams indicated for use in treating sneezing, runny nose, itchy/watery eyes, itching of nose or throat, insomnia, pruritis, urticaria, insect bites/stings, allergic rashes, and nausea.\"\n",

      "Prasterone_(14623),\"Prasterone belongs to drug node. Prasterone, also known as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a major C19 steroid produced by the adrenal cortex. It is also produced in small quantities in the testis and the ovary. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) can be converted to testosterone; androstenedione; estradiol; and estrone. Most of DHEA is sulfated (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) before secretion. DHEA can be understood as a prohormone for the sex steroids. DHEAS may be viewed as buffer and reservoir. As most DHEA is produced by the zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex, it is argued that there is a role in the immune and stress response. DHEAS/DHEA are useful to detect excess adrenal activity as seen in adrenal cancer or hyperplasia, including certain forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia as it is produced nearly entirely by the adrenal glands. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome tend to have elevated levels of DHEAS.  DHEA is naturally produced from cholesterol through two cytochrome P450 enzymes. Cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone by the enzyme P450 scc (side chain cleavage); then another enzyme, CYP17A1, converts pregnenolone to 17α-Hydroxypregnenolone and then to DHEA. DHEA is increased by exercise and calorie restriction. Some theorize that the increase in endogenous DHEA brought about by calorie restriction is partially responsible for the longer life expectancy known to be associated with calorie restriction. DHEA is taken as a supplement for a variety of unsubstantiated indications. The following indications have shown promise and are backed up by some scientific evidence: schizophrenia (DHEA may be more effective in women than men); improving the appearance of older people’s skin (taking DHEA by mouth seems to increase skin thickness and moisture, and decrease facial “age spots” in elderly men and women); improving ability to achieve an erection in men with sexual dysfunction. Additionally, DHEA has shown promise in improving symptoms of lupus (SLE). Taking DHEA by mouth along with conventional treatment may help reduce the number of times symptoms flare up and may allow a reduction in the dose of prescription drugs needed. DHEA may also help SLE symptoms such as muscle ache and mouth ulcers. DHEA also seems to strengthen bones in SLE patients being treated with high-dose steroids (corticosteroids).\"\n",

      "Protriptyline_(17305),\"Protriptyline belongs to drug node. Protriptyline hydrochloride is a dibenzocycloheptene-derivative tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). TCAs are structurally similar to phenothiazines. They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, protriptyline does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, protriptyline exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. In addition, TCAs down-regulate cerebral cortical &beta;-adrenergic receptors and sensitize post-synaptic serotonergic receptors with chronic use. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. TCAs also block histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptors, alpha<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively. See toxicity section below for a complete listing of side effects. Protriptyline may be used for the treatment of depression. Protriptyline acts by decreasing the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin (5-HT).  Protriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant. It was thought that tricyclic antidepressants work by inhibiting the reuptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin by nerve cells. The effectiveness of antidepressants appear after approximately two weeks following recommended adminsitration schedule. Gradual changes are thought to occur in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, involved in emotion regulation as part of the limbic system, as receptor sensitivity is enhanced. While &alpha;<sub>1</sub> and &beta;<sub>1</sub> receptors are sensitized, &alpha;<sub>2</sub> receptors are desensitized (leading to increased noradrenaline production). Tricyclics are also reported to alter the perceptions of pain, including neuropathic or neuralgic pain, so they may exhibit analgesic properties. The mechanism of action behind this analgesic property is not fully understood; however, it is thought to involve modulation of endogenous opioid systems in the CNS via an indirect serotonergic route. Tricyclic antidepressants are also effective in relieving migraine prophylaxis, but not in abortion of acute migraine attack, potentially via their serotonergic effects.

This drug was developed by Sankyo Co. Ltd.; however, the first approved pravastatin product was developed by Bristol Myers Squibb and FDA approved in 1991. Pravastatin is a specific inhibitor of the hepatic HMG-CoA reductase in humans. The inhibition of this enzyme produces a reduction in cholesterol biosynthesis as HMG-CoA reductase activity is an early-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Due its polarity, pravastatin binding to plasma proteins is very limited and the bound form represents only about 43-48% of the administered dose. However, the activity of p-glycoprotein in luminal apical cells and OATP1B1 produce significant changes to pravastatin distribution and elimination. The action of pravastatin on the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase produces an increase in the expression of hepatic LDL receptors which in order decreases the plasma levels of LDL cholesterol.

      "Vecuronium_(17649),\"Vecuronium belongs to drug node. Monoquaternary homolog of pancuronium. A non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent with shorter duration of action than pancuronium. Its lack of significant cardiovascular effects and lack of dependence on good kidney function for elimination as well as its short duration of action and easy reversibility provide advantages over, or alternatives to, other established neuromuscular blocking agents. Vecuronium is a bisquaternary nitrogen compound that acts by competitively binding to nicotinic cholinergic receptors. The binding of vecuronium decreases the opportunity for acetylcholine to bind to the nicotinic receptor at the postjunctional membrane of the myoneural junction. As a result, depolarization is prevented, calcium ions are not released and muscle contraction does not occur.  The principal pharmacologic effects demonstrated by vecuronium revolve around its competitive binding of cholinergic receptors located at motor end plates. This competitive binding results in muscle relaxant effects that are typically employed as an adjunct to general anesthesia.

      "Dasabuvir_(15235),\"Dasabuvir belongs to drug node. Dasabuvir is a direct acting antiviral medication used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients. Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) such as Dasabuvir. Dasabuvir is a non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitor which binds to the palm domain of NS5B and induces a conformational change which renders the polymerase unable to elongate viral RNA. The binding sites for non-nucleoside NS5B inhibitors are poorly conserved across HCV genotypes leading to the restriction of Dasabuvir's use to genotype 1 only. Dasabuvir is a non-nucleoside inhibitor of the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase encoded by the NS5B gene, which is essential for replication of the viral genome. Based on drug resistance mapping studies of HCV genotypes 1a and 1b, dasabuvir targets the palm domain of the NS5B polymerase, and is therefore referred to as a non-nucleoside NS5B-palm polymerase inhibitor. The EC50 values of dasabuvir against genotype 1a-H77 and 1b-Con1 strains in HCV replicon cell culture assays were 7.7 nM and 1.8 nM, respectively.

      "Lasmiditan_(15244),\"Lasmiditan belongs to drug node. Lasmiditan is an oral medication used in the termination of migraine headaches that was first approved for use in the United States in October 2019. The acute treatment of migraine headaches has, in the past, been achieved via constriction of cerebral blood vessels, as the acute dilation of these vessels observed during migraines was thought to be the cause of the associated pain. The neurogenic hypothesis of migraine pathophysiology, an alternative to the vascular hypothesis, suggests that cerebral vasodilation is a secondary mechanism in migraine pathogenesis, and that the main contributor to migraine headache pain is the increased pathogenic firing of trigeminal nerve pathways.  Lasmiditan exhibits a concentration-independent plasma protein binding of approximately 55-60%. Lasmiditan belongs to a new and novel class of acute anti-migraine medications that exert their effects via inhibition of neuronal firing rather than vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries. Lasmiditan appears to have a relatively quick onset of action (an important characteristic in acute migraine treatment) with some patients reporting benefit within 20 minutes. Due to its ability to cause CNS depression (e.g. drowsiness, dizziness), lasmiditan may cause significant driving impairment and patients should be advised not to participate in activities requiring mental alertness for at least 8 hours after dosing. Lasmiditan may carry some potential for abuse and should be used with caution in patients who may be at risk of drug abuse - its controlled substance scheduling is currently under review in the United States by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Lasmiditan is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults.\"\n",

Such growth leads to various symptoms like pain during periods, pelvic pain between periods, and pain during sexual intercourse. The growths themselves are referred to as lesions and frequently develop on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and other areas around the uterus, including the bowel or bladder. The growth of these lesions is dependent upon the estrogen hormone. The percentage bound to human plasma proteins for elagolix has been documented as 80%. During a three menstrual cycle study in healthy women, an elagolix 150 mg once daily regimen and a 200 mg twice daily regimen resulted in an ovulation rate of about 50% and 32%, respectively. In Phase 3 trials in women with endometriosis, elagolix caused a dose-dependent reduction in median estradiol concentrations to approximately 42 pg/mL for the 150 mg once daily regimen and 12 pg/mL for the 200 mg twice daily regimen. Elagolix is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis.\"\n",
      "Fedratinib_(15250),\"Fedratinib belongs to drug node. Fedratinib, also known as SAR302503 and TG101348, is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat intermediate-2 and high risk primary and secondary myelofibrosis. It is an anilinopyrimidine derivative. Fedratinib is an inhibitor of Janus Activated Kinase 2 (JAK2) and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3. JAK2 is highly active in myeloproliferative neoplasms like myelofibrosis. Fedratinib's inhibition of JAK2 inhibits phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 and 5, which prevents cell division and induces apoptosis. Fedratinib is ≥92% protein bound in plasma. Fedratinib is a kinase inhibitor that inhibits cell division and induces apoptosis. Patients taking fedratinib may experience anemia, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal toxicity, hepatic toxicity, or elevated amylase and lipase. These effects should be managed by reducing the dose, temporarily stopping the medication, or providing transfusions on a case by case basis. Fedratinib is indicated to treat adults with primary or secondary myelofibrosis that is either intermediate-2 or high risk.\"\n",
      "Enasidenib_(15263),\"Enasidenib belongs to drug node. Enasidenib is an orally available treatment for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with specific mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) gene, which is a recurrent mutation detected in 12-20% of adult patients with AML. Patients eligible for this treatment are selected by testing the presence of IDH2 mutations in the blood or bone marrow. This small molecule acts as an allosteric inhibitor of mutant IDH2 enzyme to prevent cell growth, and it also has shown to block several other enzymes that play a role in abnormal cell differentiation. First developed by Agios Pharmaceuticals and licensed to Celgene, enasidenib was approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration on August 1, 2017. Enasidenib is a selective inhibitor of IDH2, a mitochondria-localized enzyme involved in diverse cellular processes, including adaptation to hypoxia, histone demethylation and DNA modification. Wild-type IDH proteins play a cruicial role in the Krebs/citric acid cycle where it catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate. In comparison, mutant forms of IDH2 enzyme mediates a neomorphic activity and catalyze reduction of α-KG to the (R) etiomer of 2-hydroxyglutarate, which is associated with DNA and histone hypermethylation, altered gene expression and blocked cellular differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Enasidenib primarily targets the mutant IDH2 variants R140Q, R172S, and R172K with higher potency than the wild type enzyme form. Inhibition of the enzyme leads to decreased levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) and promotion of proper differentiation and clonal proliferation of cells of the myeloid lineage.  In vitro, human plasma protein binding of enasidenib is 98.5% and 96.6% for its metabolite AGI-16903. Both the parent drug and its main metabolite are not reported to be substrates of MRP2, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT2. AGI-16903 is a substrate for both P-glycoprotein and BCRP.  In a study involving adult patients with relapsed or refractory AML, overall response rate of 40.3% was achieved in enasidenib therapy which was associated with cellular differentiation and maturation, typically without evidence of aplasia. Enasidenib is not shown to cause QTc prolongation.  Indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with an isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2) mutation.\"\n",
      "Remdesivir_(15267),\"Remdesivir belongs to drug node. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is a respiratory disease that is capable of progressing to viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); COVID-19 can be fatal. Like other RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 depends on an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) enzyme complex for genomic replication, which can be inhibited by a class of drugs known as nucleoside analogues. COVID-19 is caused by the positive-sense RNA virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Replication of the viral genome is a key step in the infectious cycle of RNA viruses, including those of the _Filoviridae_, _Paramyxoviridae_, _Pneumoviridae_, and _Coronaviridae_ families, and is carried out by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) enzymes or enzyme complexes. For both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the RdRp comprises nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 subunits under physiological conditions, although functional RdRp complexes can be reassembled _in vitro_ that incorporate only the nsp8 and nsp12 subunits, similar to the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Remdesivir is 88-93.6% bound to human plasma proteins while its metabolites and GS-704277 are 2% and 1% bound, respectively. Remdesivir is a nucleoside analog used to inhibit the action of RNA polymerase. The duration of action is moderate, as it is given once daily. Due to much higher selectivity of mammalian DNA and RNA polymerases, including human mitochondrial RNA polymerase, for ATP over remdesivir triphosphate, remdesivir is not a significant inhibitor of these enzymes, which contributes to its overall tolerability and safety profile. Despite this, remdesivir carries risks for hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and other infusion-related reactions, elevated transaminase levels, and potential decreased efficacy when combined with or. Remdesivir is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and over weighing at least 40 kg for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection requiring hospitalization. Under this indication, remdesivir should only be administered in a hospital or other healthcare setting capable of providing acute care comparable to an inpatient hospital setting.\"\n",
      "Upadacitinib_(15269),\"Upadacitinib belongs to drug node. Upadacitinib is an oral Janus kinase (JAK)1-selective inhibitor and a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis to slow down disease progression. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease affecting the peripheral joints. It is characterized by synovial inflammation and hyperplasia, autoantibody production, cartilage damage and bone destruction, leading to co-morbidities. Despite a variety of therapeutic agents available for treatment, up to 40% of the patients do not respond to current therapies, including biological therapies. The etiology of the disease is mostly unknown; however, the role of JAK as a driver of immune-mediated conditions was discovered, leading to the use of JAK as therapeutic targets for rheumatoid arthritis. To reduce dose-related toxicity (as seen with some pan-JAK inhibitors) without significantly affecting efficacy, more selective JAK1 inhibitors, upadacitinib and , were developed. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease that involves the interplay of several mediators, including the immune cells (mainly T- and B-lymphocytes) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as the tumour necrosis factor (TNF), transforming growth factor (TGF), and interleukin 6 (IL-6). The Janus Kinase (JAK) family plays an essential role in the normal physiological functions (such as erythropoiesis), but also the signalling of pro-inflammatory cytokines that are implicated in many immune-mediated diseases. The JAK family consists of four isoforms (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and Tyrosine Kinase 2) that each interacts with different cytokine receptors and uniquely associates with the intracellular domains of Type I/II cytokine receptors. JAK1 is primarily involved in the signalling transduction pathways of IL-6, IFN and the common γ -chain cytokines, including IL-2 and IL-15. IL-6 has been closely studied in particular, as it is a major cytokine involved in B- and T-cell differentiation and the acute phase response in inflammation. Upadacitinib is 52% bound to human plasma proteins. Upadacitinib is a DMARD that works by inhibiting the Janus Kinases (JAKs), which are essential downstream cell signalling mediators of pro-inflammatory cytokines. It is believed that these pro-inflammatory cytokines play a role in many autoimmune inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis. In clinical trials, upadacitinib decreased the activity of pro-inflammatory interleukins, transiently increased the levels of lymphocytes, and insignificantly decreased the levels of immunoglobulins from the baseline. Upadacitinib is indicated for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate.\"\n",

Cobimetinib is an orally active, potent and highly selective small molecule inhibiting mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MAP2K1 or MEK1), and central components of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signal transduction pathway. It has been approved in Switzerland and the US, in combination with vemurafenib for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma. MEK inhibitor Cobimetinib specifically binds to and inhibits the catalytic activity of MEK1, resulting in inhibition of extracellular signal-related kinase 2 (ERK2) phosphorylation and activation and decreased tumor cell proliferation. Cobimetinib and vemurafenib target two different kinases in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway.  95% bound to human plasma protein. Cobimetinib is a reversible inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK)/extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that this agent is effective in inhibiting the growth of tumor cells bearing a BRAF mutation, which has been found to be associated with many tumor types. A threonine-tyrosine kinase and a key component of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signalling pathway that is frequently activated in human tumors, MEK1 is required for the transmission of growth-promoting signals from numerous receptor tyrosine kinases. Cobimetinib is used in combination with vemurafenib because the clinical benefit of a BRAF inhibitor is limited by intrinsic and acquired resistance. Reactivation of the MAPK pathway is a major contributor to treatment failure in BRAF-mutant melanomas, approximately ~80% of melanoma tumors becomes BRAF-inhibitor resistant due to reactivation of MAPK signalling. BRAF-inhibitor resistant tumor cells are sensitive to MEK inhibition, therefore cobimetinib and vemurafenib will result in dual inhibition of BRAF and its downstream target, MEK.  For the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation. Cobimetinib is used in combination with vemurafenib, a BRAF inhibitor.\"\n",
      "Bivalirudin_(14770),\"Bivalirudin belongs to drug node. Bivalirudin is a synthetic 20 residue peptide (thrombin inhibitor) which reversibly inhibits thrombin. Once bound to the active site, thrombin cannot activate fibrinogen into fibrin, the crucial step in the formation of thrombus. It is administered intravenously. Because it can cause blood stagnation, it is important to monitor changes in hematocrit, activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio and blood pressure. Inhibits the action of thrombin by binding both to its catalytic site and to its anion-binding exosite. Thrombin is a serine proteinase that plays a central role in the thrombotic process, acting to cleave fibrinogen into fibrin monomers and to activate Factor XIII to Factor XIIIa, allowing fibrin to develop a covalently cross-linked framework which stabilizes the thrombus; thrombin also activates Factors V and VIII, promoting further thrombin generation, and activates platelets, stimulating aggregation and granule release. Other than thrombin and red blood cells, bivalirudin does not bind to plasma proteins. Bivalirudin mediates an inhibitory action on thrombin by directly and specifically binding to both the catalytic site and anion-binding exosite of circulating and clot-bound thrombin. The action of bivalirudin is reversible because thrombin will slowly cleave the thrombin-bivalirudin bond which recovers the active site of thrombin.  For treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and for the prevention of thrombosis. Bivalirudin is indicated for use in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), in patients at moderate to high risk acute coronary syndromes due to unstable angina or non-ST segment elevation in whom a PCI is planned.\"\n",
      "Ticlopidine_(14771),\"Ticlopidine belongs to drug node. Ticlopidine is an effective inhibitor of platelet aggregation. It is a prodrug that is metabolised to an active form, which blocks the ADP receptor that is involved in GPIIb/IIIa receptor activation leading to platelet aggregation. Ticlopidine is marketed under the brand name Ticlid and is indicated for patients who cannot take aspirin or in whom aspirin has not worked to prevent a thrombotic stroke. The FDA label includes a black-box warning of neutropenia, aplastic anemia, thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura, and agranulocytosis, so it is necessary to monitor patients' WBC and platelets when they are taking ticlopidine. The active metabolite of ticlopidine prevents binding of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to its platelet receptor, impairing the ADP-mediated activation of the glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa complex. It is proposed that the inhibition involves a defect in the mobilization from the storage sites of the platelet granules to the outer membrane. No direct interference occurs with the GPIIb/IIIa receptor. As the glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa complex is the major receptor for fibrinogen, its impaired activation prevents fibrinogen binding to platelets and inhibits platelet aggregation. By blocking the amplification of platelet activation by released ADP, platelet aggregation induced by agonists other than ADP is also inhibited by the active metabolite of ticlopidine. Binds reversibly (98%) to plasma proteins, mainly to serum albumin and lipoproteins. The binding to albumin and lipoproteins is nonsaturable over a wide concentration range. Ticlopidine also binds to alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (about 15% or less). Ticlopidine is a prodrug that is metabolised to an as yet undetermined metabolite that acts as a platelet aggregation inhibitor. Inhibition of platelet aggregation causes a prolongation of bleeding time. In its prodrug form, ticlopidine has no significant in vitro activity at the concentrations attained in vivo. Used in patients, who have had a stroke or stroke precursors and who cannot take aspirin or aspirin has not worked, to try to prevent another thrombotic stroke.\"\n",
      "Aminosalicylic acid_(14772),\"Aminosalicylic acid belongs to drug node. An antitubercular agent often administered in association with isoniazid. The sodium salt of the drug is better tolerated than the free acid. There are two mechanisms responsible for aminosalicylic acid's bacteriostatic action against <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. Firstly, aminosalicylic acid inhibits folic acid synthesis (without potentiation with antifolic compounds). The binding of para-aminobenzoic acid to pteridine synthetase acts as the first step in folic acid synthesis. Aminosalicylic acid binds pteridine synthetase with greater affinity than para-aminobenzoic acid, effectively inhibiting the synthesis of folic acid. As bacteria are unable to use external sources of folic acid, cell growth and multiplication slows. Secondly, aminosalicylic acid may inhibit the synthesis of the cell wall component, mycobactin, thus reducing iron uptake by <i>M. tuberculosis</i>. 50-60% Aminosalicylic acid is an anti-mycobacterial agent used with other anti-tuberculosis drugs (most often isoniazid) for the treatment of all forms of active tuberculosis due to susceptible strains of tubercle bacilli. The two major considerations in the clinical pharmacology of aminosalicylic acid are the prompt production of a toxic inactive metabolite under acid conditions and the short serum half life of one hour for the free drug. Aminosalicylic acid is bacteriostatic against <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (prevents the multiplying of bacteria without destroying them). It also inhibits the onset of bacterial resistance to streptomycin and isoniazid. For the treatment of tuberculosis\"\n",

Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins. It is possible that cefaclor interferes with an autolysin inhibitor. 23.5% Cefaclor is a second generation cephalosporin antibiotic with a spectrum resembling first-generation cephalosporins. <i>In vitro</i> tests demonstrate that the bactericidal action of the cephalosporins results from inhibition of cell-wall synthesis. As indicated by _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ clinical studies, cefaclor was shown to be effective against most strains of Gram positive aerobes - Staphylococci (including coagulase-positive, coagulase-negative, and penicillinase-producing strains), <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>, <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> (group A &szlig;-hemolytic streptococci), as well as Gram-negative aerobes - <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> (including &szlig;-lactamase-producing ampicillin-resistant strains), <i>Klebsiella sp</i>, and <i>Proteus mirabilis</i>.

      "Calcipotriol_(14775),\"Calcipotriol belongs to drug node. Calcipotriol (INN) or calcipotriene (USAN) is a sythetic derivative of calcitriol or Vitamin D. The precise mechanism of calcipotriol in remitting psoriasis is not well-understood, however, it has been shown to have comparable affinity with calcitriol for the Vitamin D receptor while being less than 1% the activity in regulating calcium metabolism. The Vitamin D receptor (VDR) belongs to the steroid/thyroid receptor superfamily, and is found on the cells of many different tissues including the thyroid, bone, kindney, and T cells of the immune system. T cells are known to play a role in psoriasis and are believed to undergo modulation of gene expression with binding of calcipotriol to the VDR. This modulation is thought to affect gene products related to cell differentiation and proliferation.  Calcipotriene is a synthetic analog of vitamin D. In humans, the natural supply of vitamin D depends mainly on exposure to the ultraviolet rays of the sun for conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) in the skin.

      "Tiopronin_(14779),\"Tiopronin belongs to drug node. Tiopronin is a prescription thiol drug used primarily in the treatment of severe homozygous cystinuria. Patients with cystinuria excrete high levels of cystine in their urine and are at risk for kidney stone formation. Tiopronin is used as a second-line therapy to control the rate of cystine precipitation and excretion, and prevent kidney stone formation. It is used after a failure of the non-pharmacological first line treatment consisting of increased fluid intake, restriction of sodium and protein, and urinary alkalinization. As cystinuria is a relatively rare disease, tiopronin is classified as an orphan drug and is not patented in the United States. It is similar to d-penicillamine in use and efficacy, but offers the advantage of far less adverse effects. Tiopronin is dosed on an individual basis using close monitoring of urinary cystine concentrations and urinary output. Kidney stones form when the solubility limit is exceeded and urine becomes supersaturated with endogenous cystine. Tiopronin is an active reducing agent which undergoes a thiol-disulfide exchange with cystine to form a water-soluble mixed disulfide complex. Thus, the amount of sparingly soluble cystine is reduced. By reducing urinary cystine concentrations below the solubility limit, tiopronin helps reduce cystine stone formation.  Tiopronin undergoes extensive protein binding in plasma. It is thought that this occurs through the formation of a disulphide bridge to the free thiol group of albumin.  Tiopronin is indicated for the prevention of kidney stone formation in patients with severe homozygous cystinuria consisting of a urinary cystine concentration greater than 500 mg/day, and who have failed treatment with non-pharmacological measures of increased fluid intake, decreased sodium and protein intake, and urine alkalinization.\"\n",
      "Cytarabine_(14780),\"Cytarabine belongs to drug node. A pyrimidine nucleoside analog that is used mainly in the treatment of leukemia, especially acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia. Cytarabine is an antimetabolite antineoplastic agent that inhibits the synthesis of DNA. Its actions are specific for the S phase of the cell cycle. It also has antiviral and immunosuppressant properties. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p472) Cytarabine acts through direct DNA damage and incorporation into DNA. Cytarabine is cytotoxic to a wide variety of proliferating mammalian cells in culture. It exhibits cell phase specificity, primarily killing cells undergoing DNA synthesis (S-phase) and under certain conditions blocking the progression of cells from the G1 phase to the S-phase. Although the mechanism of action is not completely understood, it appears that cytarabine acts through the inhibition of DNA polymerase. A limited, but significant, incorporation of cytarabine into both DNA and RNA has also been reported. 13% Cytarabine is an antineoplastic anti-metabolite used in the treatment of several forms of leukemia including acute myelogenous leukemia and meningeal leukemia. Anti-metabolites masquerade as purine or pyrimidine - which become the building blocks of DNA. They prevent these substances becoming incorporated in to DNA during the \\S\\\"\" phase (of the cell cycle), stopping normal development and division. Cytarabine is metabolized intracellularly into its active triphosphate form (cytosine arabinoside triphosphate). This metabolite then damages DNA by multiple mechanisms, including the inhibition of alpha-DNA polymerase, inhibition of DNA repair through an effect on beta-DNA polymerase, and incorporation into DNA. The latter mechanism is probably the most important. Cytotoxicity is highly specific for the S phase of the cell cycle.\"\" For the treatment of acute non-lymphocytic leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia and blast phase of chronic myelocytic leukemia.\"\n",
      "Omeprazole_(14785),\"Omeprazole belongs to drug node. Originally approved by the FDA in 1989, omeprazole is a _proton-pump inhibitor_, used to treat gastric acid-related disorders.

As a PPI, lansoprazole is a prodrug and requires protonation via an acidic environment to become activated.  Once protonated, lansoprazole is able to react with cysteine residues, specifically Cys813 and Cys321, on parietal H+,K+-ATPase resulting in stable disulfides. PPI's in general are able to provide prolonged inhibition of acid secretion due to their ability to bind covalently to their targets.   97% of lansoprazole is plasma protein bound.  Lansoprazole decreases gastric acid secretion by targeting H+,K+-ATPase, which is the enzyme that catalyzes the final step in the acid secretion pathway in parietal cells.  Conveniently, lansoprazole administered any time of day is able to inhibit both daytime and nocturnal acid secretion. The result is that lansoprazole is effective at healing duodenal ulcers, reduces ulcer-related pain, and offers relief from symptoms of heartburn  Lansoprazole also reduces pepsin secretion, making it a useful treatment option for hypersecretory conditions such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Lansoprazole is used to reduce gastric acid secretion and is approved for short term treatment of active gastric ulcers, active duodenal ulcers, erosive reflux oesophagitis, symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) induced gastric and duodenal ulcers.  It may be used in the maintece and healing of several gastric conditions including duodenal ulcers, NSAID related gastric ulcers, and erosive esophagitis. Lansoprazole prevents recurrence of gastric ulcers in patients who have a documented history of gastric ulcers who also use NSAIDs chronically.  Predictably, it is also useful in the management of hypersecretory conditions including Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.  Lansoprazole is effective at eradicating H. pylori when used in conjunction with amoxicillin and clarithromycin (triple therapy) or with amoxicillin alone (dual therapy). \"\n",
      "Amodiaquine_(14788),\"Amodiaquine belongs to drug node. A 4-aminoquinoquinoline compound with anti-inflammatory properties. The mechanism of plasmodicidal action of amodiaquine is not completely certain. Like other quinoline derivatives, it is thought to inhibit heme polymerase activity. This results in accumulation of free heme, which is toxic to the parasites. The drug binds the free heme preventing the parasite from converting it to a form less toxic. This drug-heme complex is toxic and disrupts membrane function.  Amodiaquine, a 4-aminoquinoline similar to chloroquine in structure and activity, has been used as both an antimalarial and an anti-inflammatory agent for more than 40 years. Amodiaquine is at least as effective as chloroquine, and is effective against some chloroquine-resistant strains, although resistance to amodiaquine has been reported. The mode of action of amodiaquine has not yet been determined. 4-Aminoquinolines depress cardiac muscle, impair cardiac conductivity, and produce vasodilatation with resultant hypotension. They depress respiration and cause diplopia, dizziness and nausea. For treatment of acute malarial attacks in non-immune subjects.\"\n",
      "Daunorubicin_(14789),\"Daunorubicin belongs to drug node. A very toxic anthracycline aminoglycoside antineoplastic isolated from Streptomyces peucetius and others, used in treatment of leukemia and other neoplasms. Daunorubicin has antimitotic and cytotoxic activity through a number of proposed mechanisms of action: Daunorubicin forms complexes with DNA by intercalation between base pairs, and it inhibits topoisomerase II activity by stabilizing the DNA-topoisomerase II complex, preventing the religation portion of the ligation-religation reaction that topoisomerase II catalyzes. 97% binding-albumin Daunorubicin is an antineoplastic in the anthracycline class. General properties of drugs in this class include: interaction with DNA in a variety of different ways including intercalation (squeezing between the base pairs), DNA strand breakage and inhibition with the enzyme topoisomerase II. Most of these compounds have been isolated from natural sources and antibiotics. However, they lack the specificity of the antimicrobial antibiotics and thus produce significant toxicity. The anthracyclines are among the most important antitumor drugs available. Doxorubicin is widely used for the treatment of several solid tumors while daunorubicin and idarubicin are used exclusively for the treatment of leukemia. Daunorubicin may also inhibit polymerase activity, affect regulation of gene expression, and produce free radical damage to DNA. Daunorubicin possesses an antitumor effect against a wide spectrum of tumors, either grafted or spontaneous. The anthracyclines are cell cycle-nonspecific. For remission induction in acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (myelogenous, monocytic, erythroid) of adults and for remission induction in acute lymphocytic leukemia of children and adults.\"\n",
      "Primaquine_(14790),\"Primaquine belongs to drug node. An aminoquinoline that is given by mouth to produce a radical cure and prevent relapse of vivax and ovale malarias following treatment with a blood schizontocide. It has also been used to prevent transmission of falciparum malaria by those returning to areas where there is a potential for re-introduction of malaria. Adverse effects include anemias and GI disturbances. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopeia, 30th ed, p404) Primaquine's mechanism of action is not well understood. It may be acting by generating reactive oxygen species or by interfering with the electron transport in the parasite. Also, although its mechanism of action is unclear, primaquine may bind to and alter the properties of protozoal DNA.  Primaquine is an antimalarial agent and is the essential co-drug with chloroquine in treating all cases of malaria. In the blood, malaria parasites break down a part of the red blood cells known as haemoglobin. When this happens haemoglobin is divided into two parts; haem and globin. Haem is toxic to the malaria parasite. To prevent it from being damaged, the malaria parasite produces an chemical which converts the toxic haem into a non-toxic product. Primaquine acts by interfering with a part of the parasite (mitochondria) that is responsible for supplying it with energy. Without energy the parasite dies. This stops the infection from continuing and allows the person to recover. Primaquine kills the intrahepatic form of <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> and <i>Plasmodium ovale</i>, and thereby prevents the development of the erythrocytic forms that are responsible for relapses (it also kills gametocytes). Primaquine is not used in the prevention of malaria, only in the treatment. It has insignificant activity against the asexual blood forms of the parasite and therefore it is always used in conjunction with a blood schizonticide and never as a single agent. Primaquine has gametocytocidal activity against all plasmodia, including <i>P. falciparum</i>. For the treatment of malaria.\"\n",

      "Paclitaxel_(14792),\"Paclitaxel belongs to drug node. Paclitaxel is a chemotherapeutic agent marketed under the brand name Taxol among others. Used as a treatment for various cancers, paclitaxel is a mitotic inhibitor that was first isolated in 1971 from the bark of the Pacific yew tree which contains endophytic fungi that synthesize paclitaxel. It is available as an intravenous solution for injection and the newer formulation contains albumin-bound paclitaxel marketed under the brand name Abraxane. Paclitaxel interferes with the normal function of microtubule growth. Whereas drugs like colchicine cause the depolymerization of microtubules in vivo, paclitaxel arrests their function by having the opposite effect; it hyper-stabilizes their structure. This destroys the cell's ability to use its cytoskeleton in a flexible manner. Specifically, paclitaxel binds to the &beta; subunit of tubulin. Tubulin is the \\building block\\\"\" of mictotubules, and the binding of paclitaxel locks these building blocks in place. The resulting microtubule/paclitaxel complex does not have the ability to disassemble. This adversely affects cell function because the shortening and lengthening of microtubules (termed dynamic instability) is necessary for their function as a transportation highway for the cell. Chromosomes, for example, rely upon this property of microtubules during mitosis. Further research has indicated that paclitaxel induces programmed cell death (apoptosis) in cancer cells by binding to an apoptosis stopping protein called Bcl-2 (B-cell leukemia 2) and thus arresting its function.\"\" 89%-98% bound to plasma protein. The presence of cimetidine, ranitidine, dexamethasone, or diphenhydramine did not affect protein binding of paclitaxel. Paclitaxel is a taxoid antineoplastic agent indicated as first-line and subsequent therapy for the treatment of advanced carcinoma of the ovary, and other various cancers including breast cancer. Paclitaxel is a novel antimicrotubule agent that promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilizes microtubules by preventing depolymerization. This stability results in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions. In addition, paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or \\bundles\\\"\" of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis.\"\" Used in the treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma and cancer of the lung, ovarian, and breast.

A centerally active cholinesterase inhibitor that has been used to counter the effects of muscle relaxants, as a respiratory stimulant, and in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other central nervous system disorders. Tacrine has been discontinued for the United States market. The mechanism of tacrine is not fully known, but it is suggested that the drug is an anticholinesterase agent which reversibly binds with and inactivates cholinesterases. This inhibits the hydrolysis of acetylcholine released from functioning cholinergic neurons, thus leading to an accumulation of acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses. The result is a prolonged effect of acetylcholine. 55% Tacrine is a parasympathomimetic- a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor that is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer's type. An early pathophysiological feature of Alzheimer's disease that is associated with memory loss and cognitive deficits is a deficiency of acetylcholine as a result of selective loss of cholinergic neurons in the cerebral cortex, nucleus basalis, and hippocampus. Tacrine is postulated to exert its therapeutic effect by enhancing cholinergic function. This is accomplished by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses through reversible inhibition of its hydrolysis by acetylcholinesterase. If this proposed mechanism of action is correct, tacrine's effect may lessen as the disease progresses and fewer cholinergic neurons remain functionally intact.

Although its mechanism of action is not completely clear, streptozocin is known to inhibit DNA synthesis, interfere with biochemical reactions of NAD and NADH, and inhibit some enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis. Its activity appears to occur as a result of formation of methylcarbonium ions, which alkylate or bind with many intracellular molecular structures including nucleic acids. Its cytotoxic action is probably due to cross-linking of strands of DNA, resulting in inhibition of DNA synthesis.  Streptozocin is an antitumour antibiotic consisting of a nitrosourea moiety interposed between a methyl group and a glucosamine. Streptozocin is indicated in the treatment of metastatic islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas. Streptozocin inhibits DNA synthesis in bacterial and mammalian cells. In bacterial cells, a specific interaction with cytosine moieties leads to degradation of DNA. The biochemical mechanism leading to mammalian cell death has not been definitely established; streptozocin inhibits cell proliferation at a considerably lower level than that needed to inhibit precursor incorporation into DNA or to inhibit several of the enzymes involved in DNA synthesis.

Trimethoprim is an antifolate antibacterial agent that inhibits bacterial dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), a critical enzyme that catalyzes the formation of tetrahydrofolic acid (THF) - in doing so, it prevents the synthesis of bacterial DNA and ultimately continued bacterial survival. Trimethoprim is often used in combination with due to their complementary and synergistic mechanisms but may be used as a monotherapy in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of urinary tract infections. It is structurally and chemically related to , another antifolate antimicrobial used in the treatment of plasmodial infections. Trimethoprim is a reversible inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase, one of the principal enzymes catalyzing the formation of tetrahydrofolic acid (THF) from dihydrofolic acid (DHF). Tetrahydrofolic acid is necessary for the biosynthesis of bacterial nucleic acids and proteins and ultimately for continued bacterial survival - inhibiting its synthesis, then, results in bactericidal activity. Trimethoprim binds with a much stronger affinity to bacterial dihydrofolate reductase as compared to its mammalian counterpart, allowing trimethoprim to selectively interfere with bacterial biosynthetic processes.  Trimethoprim is 44% bound to plasma proteins, though the specific proteins to which it binds have not been elucidated. Trimethoprim exerts its antimicrobial effects by inhibiting an essential step in the synthesis of bacterial nucleic acids and proteins. It has shown activity against several species of gram-negative bacteria, as well as coagulase-negative _Staphylococcus_ species. Resistance to trimethoprim may arise via a variety of mechanisms, including alterations to the bacterial cell wall, overproduction of dihydrofolate reductase, or production of resistant dihydrofolate reductase. Rarely, trimethoprim can precipitate the development of blood disorders (e.g. thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, etc.) which may be preceded by symptoms such as sore throat, fever, pallor, and or purpura - patients should be monitored closely for the development of these symptoms throught the course of therapy.

(From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p38) Albendazole causes degenerative alterations in the tegument and intestinal cells of the worm by diminishing its energy production, ultimately leading to immobilization and death of the parasite. It works by binding to the colchicine-sensitive site of tubulin, thus inhibiting its polymerization or assembly into microtubules. As cytoplasmic microtubules are critical in promoting glucose uptake in larval and adult stages of the susceptible parasites, the glycogen stores of the parasites are depleted. Degenerative changes in the endoplasmic reticulum, the mitochondria of the germinal layer, and the subsequent release of lysosomes result in decreased production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the energy required for the survival of the helminth.  70% bound to plasma protein Albendazole is a broad-spectrum anthelmintic.

In July 2019, apremilast was granted a new FDA approval for the treatment of oral ulcers associated with Behcet's disease, an autoimmune condition that causes recurrent skin, blood vessel, and central nervous system inflammation. The full mechanism of action of this drug is not fully established, however, it is known that apremilast is an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), which mediates the activity of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a second messenger. The inhibition of PDE4 by apremilast leads to increased intracellular cAMP levels. An increase in cAMP results in the suppression of inflammation by decreasing the expression of TNF-α, IL-17, IL-23, and other inflammatory mediators. The above inflammatory mediators have been implicated in various psoriatic conditions as well as Behcet's disease, leading to their undesirable inflammatory symptoms such as mouth ulcers, skin lesions, and arthritis. Apremilast administration leads to a cascade which eventually decreases the levels of the above mediators, relieving inflammatory symptoms. The plasma protein binding of apremilast is about 68%. Apremilast reduces but does not completely inhibit various inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1α, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 MCP-1, MIP-1β, MMP-3, and TNF-α, relieving the symptoms of psoriasis and Behcet's disease, which are caused by an increase in these inflammatory mediators. This drug has also been proven to be effective in relieving the pain associated with oral ulcers in Behcet's disease.  Apremilast is indicated for the treating of active psoriatic arthritis in adults, for the treating of active moderate to severe psoriatic arthritis in patients who are eligible for phototherapy and systemic treatment.

In addition to improvements in blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), muraglitazar treatment is associated with a substantial reduction in triglycerides (TGs), an increase in HDL-C, and a modest decrease in LDL-C levels. Muraglitazar is one of the dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists. It interacts with both PPAR alpha and gamma receptors. Working through the PPAR gamma receptor, muraglitazar has very potent insulin-sensitizing effects on liver and muscle to lower the blood sugar levels. working through the PPAR alpha receptor, muraglitazar is very potent in terms of lowering the triglycerides and raising the HDL cholesterol and converting small dense LDL particles to larger, more buoyant particles, so it promotes a very good lipid profile from the standpoint of prevention of atherosclerosis.   Investigated for use/treatment in diabetes mellitus type 2.\"\n",
      "Pomalidomide_(15367),\"Pomalidomide belongs to drug node. Pomalidomide, an analogue of thalidomide, is an immunomodulatory antineoplastic agent. FDA approved on February 8, 2013. Promalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent with antineoplastic activity. It is shown to inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis of various tumour cells. Furthermore, promalidomide enhances T cell and natural killer (NK) cell-mediated immunity and inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, like TNF-alpha or IL-6, by monocytes. The primary target of promalidomide is thought to be the protein cereblon. It binds to this target and inhibits ubiquitin ligase activity. It is also a transcriptional inhibitor of COX2.  12-44% protein bound. It is not concentration dependent.  Pomalidomide is more potent than thalidomide (100-times) and lenalidomide (10-times).  Pomalidomide is indicated for patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and bortezomib and have demonstrated disease progression on or within 60 days of completion of the last therapy.\"\n",
      "Fluorouracil_(14190),\"Fluorouracil belongs to drug node. A pyrimidine analog that is an antineoplastic antimetabolite. It interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking the thymidylate synthetase conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid. The precise mechanism of action has not been fully determined, but the main mechanism of fluorouracil is thought to be the binding of the deoxyribonucleotide of the drug (FdUMP) and the folate cofactor, N5–10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, to thymidylate synthase (TS) to form a covalently bound ternary complex. This results in the inhibition of the formation of thymidylate from uracil, which leads to the inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis and cell death. Fluorouracil can also be incorporated into RNA in place of uridine triphosphate (UTP), producing a fraudulent RNA and interfering with RNA processing and protein synthesis. 8-12% Fluorouracil is an antineoplastic anti-metabolite. Anti-metabolites masquerade as purine or pyrimidine - which become the building blocks of DNA. They prevent these substances from becoming incorporated into DNA during the \\S\\\"\" phase (of the cell cycle), stopping normal development and division. Fluorouracil blocks an enzyme which converts the cytosine nucleotide into the deoxy derivative. In addition, DNA synthesis is further inhibited because Fluorouracil blocks the incorporation of the thymidine nucleotide into the DNA strand.\"\" For the topical treatment of multiple actinic or solar keratoses. In the 5% strength it is also useful in the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinomas when conventional methods are impractical, such as with multiple lesions or difficult treatment sites. Fluorouracil injection is indicated in the palliative management of some types of cancer, including colon, esophageal, gastric, rectum, breast, biliary tract, stomach, head and neck, cervical, pancreas, renal cell, and carcinoid.\"\n",
      "Lamotrigine_(14192),\"Lamotrigine belongs to drug node. Lamotrigine is an antiepileptic drug belonging in the phenyltriazine class. It is used in the treatment of both epilepsy and as a mood stabilizer in bipolar disorder. Lamotrigine is the first medication since lithium granted Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the maintece treatment of bipolar type I.  It is approved for use in more than 30 countries. The exact mechanism of action of lamotrigine is not fully elucidated, as it may exert cellular activities that contribute to its efficacy in a range of conditions. Although chemically unrelated, lamotrigine actions resemble those of phenytoin and carbamazepine, inhibiting voltage-sensitive sodium channels, stabilizing neuronal membranes, thereby modulating the release of presynaptic excitatory neurotransmitters.  The plasma protein binding of lamotrigine is estimated at 55%. This drug is not expected to undergo clinically significant interactions with other drugs via competition for protein binding sites due its lower protein binding. Lamotrigine likely prevents seizures and prevents mood symptoms via stabilizing presynaptic neuronal membranes and preventing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate, which contribute to seizure activity.  Lamotrigine is indicated as adjunctive therapy for the following seizure types in patients ≥2 years of age: partial seizures, primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and generalized seizures due to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.\"\n",
      "Hydroxyzine_(14193),\"Hydroxyzine belongs to drug node. Hydroxyzine is a first-generation histamine H<sub>1</sub>-receptor antagonist of the dephenylmethane and piperazine classes that exhibits sedative, anxiolytic, and antiemetic properties. It was first developed in 1955, and has since remained a relatively common treatment for allergic conditions such as pruritus, urticaria, dermatoses, and histamine-mediated pruritus. The active metabolite of hydroxyzine, , is also available as an active ingredient in allergic medications, and is responsible for much of its hydroxyzine's antihistaminic effect. Hydroxyzine is also used for generalized anxiety disorder, tension caused by psychoneurosis, and other conditions with manifestations of anxiety. The H<sub>1</sub> histamine receptor is responsible for mediating hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. Exposure to an allergen results in degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H<sub>1</sub> receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes. Hydroxyzine has been shown to bind to human albumin _in vitro_, but the extent of protein binding in plasma has not been evaluated. Hydroxyzine blocks the activity of histamine to relieve allergic symptoms such as pruritus. Activity at off-targets also allows for its use as a sedative anxiolytic and an antiemetic in certain disease states. Hydroxyzine is indicated for the symptomatic relief of anxiety and tension associated with psychoneuroses, and as an adjunct in organic disease states in which anxiety is manifested. It is also indicated in the treatment of histamine-mediated pruritus and pruritus due to allergic conditions such as chronic urticaria.\"\n",
      "Methotrexate_(14194),\"Methotrexate belongs to drug node. Methotrexate is a folate derivative that inhibits several enzymes responsible for nucleotide synthesis. This inhibition leads to suppression of inflammation as well as prevention of cell division. Because of these effects, methotrexate is often used to treat inflammation caused by arthritis or to control cell division in neoplastic diseases such as breast cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Methotrexate enters tissues and is converted to a methotrexate polyglutamate by folylpolyglutamate. Methotrexate is 46.5-54% bound to plasma proteins. Methotrexate inhibits enzymes responsible for nucleotide synthesis which prevents cell division and leads to anti-inflammatory actions. It has a long duration of action and is generally given to patients once weekly. Methotrexate has a narrow therapeutic index. Methotrexate oral solution is indicated for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia and pediatric polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Methotrexate injections for subcutaneous use are indicated for severe active rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis.\"\n",
      "Cephalexin_(14195),\"Cephalexin belongs to drug node. Cephalexin is the first of the first generation cephalosporins. This antibiotic contains a beta lactam and a dihydrothiazide. Cephalexin is used to treat a number of susceptible bacterial infections through inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Cephalexin was approved by the FDA on 4 January 1971. Cephalexin is a first generation cephalosporin antibiotic. Cephalosporins contain a beta lactam and dihydrothiazide. Unlike penicillins, cephalosprins are more resistant to the action of beta lactamase. Cephalexin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, leading breakdown and eventualy cell death. Cephalexin is 10-15% bound to serum proteins including serum albumin. Cephalexin (also called Cefalexin) is a first generation cephalosporin antibiotic. It is one of the most widely prescribed antibiotics, often used for the treatment of superficial infections that result as complications of minor wounds or lacerations. It is effective against most gram-positive bacteria through its inihibition of the cross linking reaction between N-acetyl muramicacid and N-acetylglucosamine in the cell wall, leading to cell lysis. Cephalexin is indicated for the treatment of certain infections caused by susceptible bacteria. These infections include respiratory tract infections, otitis media, skin and skin structure infections, bone infections, and genitourinary tract infections.\"\n",
      "Propranolol_(14196),\"Propranolol belongs to drug node. Propranolol is a racemic mixture of 2 etiomers where the S(-)-etiomer has approximately 100 times the binding affinity for beta adrenergic receptors. Propranolol is used to treat a number of conditions but most commonly is used for hypertension.  Propranolol is a nonselective β-adrenergic receptor antagonist. Blocking of these receptors leads to vasoconstriction, inhibition of angiogenic factors like vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic growth factor of fibroblasts (bFGF), induction of apoptosis of endothelial cells, as well as down regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Approximately 90% of propranolol is protein bound in plasma. Other studies have reported ranges of 85-96%. Propranolol is a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist used to treat hypertension. Propranolol has a long duration of action as it is given once or twice daily depending on the indication. When patients abruptly stop taking propranolol, they may experience exacerbations of angina and myocardial infarctions. Propranolol is indicated to treat hypertension. Propranolol is also indicated to treat angina pectoris due to coronary atherosclerosis, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, migraine, essential tremor, hypertrophic subaortic stenosis, pheochromocytoma, and proliferating infantile hemangioma.\"\n",
      "Fenoprofen_(14197),\"Fenoprofen belongs to drug node. An anti-inflammatory analgesic and antipyretic highly bound to plasma proteins. It is pharmacologically similar to aspirin, but causes less gastrointestinal bleeding. Fenoprofen's exact mode of action is unknown, but it is thought that prostaglandin synthetase inhibition is involved. Fenoprofen has been shown to inhibit prostaglandin synthetase isolated from bovine seminal vesicles. 99% to albumin. Fenoprofen is a propionic acid derivative with analgesic, antiinflammatory and antipyretic properties. Fenoprofen inhibits prostaglandin synthesis by decreasing the enzyme needed for biosynthesis. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the anti-inflammatory action of fenoprofen has been evidenced by relief of pain, increase in grip strength, and reductions in joint swelling, duration of morning stiffness, and disease activity (as assessed by both the investigator and the patient). In patients with osteoarthritis, the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of fenoprofen have been demonstrated by reduction in tenderness as a response to pressure and reductions in night pain, stiffness, swelling, and overall disease activity (as assessed by both the patient and the investigator). These effects have also been demonstrated by relief of pain with motion and at rest and increased range of motion in involved joints. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, clinical studies have shown fenoprofen to be comparable to aspirin in controlling the aforementioned measures of disease activity, but mild gastrointestinal reactions (nausea, dyspepsia) and tinnitus occurred less frequently in patients treated with fenoprofen than in aspirin-treated patients. It is not known whether fenoprofen causes less peptic ulceration than does aspirin. In patients with pain, the analgesic action of fenoprofen has produced a reduction in pain intensity, an increase in pain relief, improvement in total analgesia scores, and a sustained analgesic effect. For relief of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Also for the relief of mild to moderate pain.\"\n",
      "Clonidine_(14198),\"Clonidine belongs to drug node. Clonidine is an imidazole derivate that acts as an agonist of alpha-2 adrenoceptors. This activity is useful for the treatment of hypertension, severe pain, and ADHD. Clonidine is primarily an alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist which causes central hypotensive and anti-arrhythmogenic effects. The alpha-2 adrenoceptor is coupled to the G-proteins G<sub>o</sub> and G<sub>i</sub>. G<sub>i</sub> inhibits adenylyl cyclase and activates opening of a potassium channel that causes hyperpolarization. Clonidine binding to the alpha-2 adrenoceptor causes structural changes in the alpha subunit of the G-protein, reducing its affinity for GDP. Magnesium catalyzes the replacement of GDP with GTP. The alpha subunit dissociates from the other subunits and associates with an effector. Clonidine is 20-40% bound to plasma proteins, especially albumin. Clonidine functions through agonism of alpha-2 adrenoceptors which have effects such as lowering blood pressure, sedation, and hyperpolarization of nerves. It has a long duration of action as it is given twice daily and the therapeutic window is between 0.1mg and 2.4mg daily. Clonidine tablets and transdermal systems are indicated for the treatment of hypertension alone or in combination with other medications. A clonidine injection is indicated for use with opiates in the treatment of severe cancer pain where opiates alone are insufficient. An extended release tablet of clonidine is indicated for the treatment of ADHD either alone or in combination with other medications.\"\n",
      "Enalapril_(14200),\"Enalapril belongs to drug node. Enalapril is a prodrug belonging to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor drug class that works on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which is responsible for the regulation of blood pressure and fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. Enalapril is an orally-active and long-acting nonsulphydryl antihypertensive agent that suppresses the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to lower blood pressure. It was developed from a targeted research programmed using molecular modelling. Being a prodrug, enalapril is rapidly biotransformed into its active metabolite, , which is responsible for the pharmacological actions of enalapril. The active metabolite of enalapril competitively inhibits the ACE to hinder the production of angiotensin II, a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that promotes vasoconstriction and renal reabsorption of sodium ions in the kidneys. Ultimately, enalaprilat works to reduce blood pressure and blood fluid volume. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a signaling pathway that works in synergism with the sympathetic system to regulate blood pressure and fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. Activation of this system upon stimulation by different factors, such as low blood pressure and nerve impulses, leads to increased release of norepinephrine (NE) from sympathetic nerve terminals and effects on the vascular growth, vasoconstriction, and salt retention in the kidneys. Renin is released from  It is reported that less than 50% of enalaprilat is bound to human plasma proteins, based on limited data from binding studies of enalaprilat in human plasma both by equilibrium dialysis and by ultrafiltration. Enalapril is an antihypertensive agent that exhibits natriuretic and uricosuric properties. Enalapril lowers blood pressure in all grades of essential and renovascular hypertension, and peripheral vascular resistance without causing an increase in heart rate. Individuals with low-renin hypertensive population were still responsive to enalapril. The duration of hypertensive effect in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure persists for at least 24 hours following initial administration of a single oral dose, and repeated daily administration of enalapril confers an additional reduction in blood pressure and a steady-state antihypertensive response may take several weeks. In patients with severe congestive heart failure and inadequate clinical response to conventional antihypertensive therapies, treatment with enalapril resulted in improvements in cardiac performance as observed by a reduction in both preload and afterload, and improved clinical status long-term. Furthermore, enalapril was shown to increase cardiac output and stroke volume while decreasing pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in patients with congestive heart failure refractory to conventional treatment with digitalis and diuretics. In clinical studies, enalapril reduced left ventricular mass, and did not affect cardiac function or myocardial perfusion during exercise. Enalapril is not highly associated with the risk of bradycardia unlike most diuretics and beta-blockers and it does not produce rebound hypertension upon discontinuation of therapy.  Indicated for the management of essential or renovascular hypertension as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive agents, such as thiazide diuretics, for an additive effect.\"\n",
      "Medroxyprogesterone acetate_(14203),\"Medroxyprogesterone acetate belongs to drug node. Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is a derivative that is more resistant to metabolism for improved pharmacokinetic properties. MPA can be use to treat secondary amenorrhea, endometrial hyperplasia, abnormal uterine bleeding, osteoporosis, vasomotor symptoms in menopause, vulvar and vaginal atrophy, prevent pregcy, manage pain in endometriosis, prevent pregcy, and is also used in palliative care for endometrial and renal carcinoma. Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) inhibits the production of gonadotropin, preventing follicular maturation and ovulation, which is responsible for it’s ability to prevent pregcy. This action also thins the endometrium. MPA reduces nuclear estrogen receptors and DNA synthesis in epithelial cells of the endometrium. MPA can also induce p53 dependant apoptosis in certain cancer cell lines, and inhibit GABA-A receptors. Medroxyprogesterone acetate is 86% protein bound in serum, mainly to albumin. No binding occurs with sex hormone binding globulin. Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) inhibits gonadotropin production, reduces nuclear estrogen receptors and DNA synthesis in epithelial cells of the endometrium, and induces p53 dependant apoptosis in cancer cell lines. MPA oral tablets have a half life of 40-60 hours and other formulations can have half lives that are considerably longer, so the duration of action is long. The therapeutic window is wide as patients may take doses ranging from 5mg orally daily to 1000mg as a depo injection weekly. Long term use of MPA is associated with a reduction in bone density and patients who taking MPA during adolescence may have lower peak bone mass than untreated patients, which can also increase the risk of osteoporosis and fractures in the future. Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) oral tablets are indicated to treat secondary amenorrhea, reduce the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia in postmenopausal women, and to treat abnormal uterine bleeding due to hormonal imbalance, not organic pathology. Oral tablets containing MPA and conjugated estrogens are indicated to prevent postmenopausal osteoporosis and to treat moderate to severe menopausal symptoms such as vasomotor symptoms, vulvar atrophy, and vaginal atrophy. Subcutaneous MPA is indicated to prevent pregcy and manage pain associated with endometriosis. Intramuscular MPA is indicated to prevent pregcy, and at higher concentrations for palliative treatment of endometrial or renal carcinoma.\"\n",
      "Chloroquine_(14206),\"Chloroquine belongs to drug node. Chloroquine is an aminoquinolone derivative first developed in the 1940s for the treatment of malaria. It was the drug of choice to treat malaria until the development of newer antimalarials such as , , and. Chloroquine and its derivative have since been repurposed for the treatment of a number of other conditions including HIV, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis. Chloroquine inhibits the action of heme polymerase in malarial trophozoites, preventing the conversion of heme to hemazoin. _Plasmodium_ species continue to accumulate toxic heme, killing the parasite. Chloroquine is 46-74% bound to plasma proteins. (-)-chloroquine binds more strongly to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein and (+)-chloroquine binds more strongly to serum albumin. Chloroquine inhibits the action of heme polymerase, which causes the buildup of toxic heme in _Plasmodium_ species. It has a long duration of action as the half life is 20-60 days. Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of retinopathy with long term usage or high dosage, muscle weakness, and toxicity in children. Chloroquine is indicated to treat infections of _P. vivax_, _P. malariae_, _P. ovale_, and susceptible strains of _P. falciparum_. It is also used to treat extraintestinal amebiasis.\"\n",
      "Imatinib_(14207),\"Imatinib belongs to drug node. Imatinib is a small molecule kinase inhibitor used to treat certain types of cancer. It is currently marketed by Novartis as Gleevec (USA) or Glivec (Europe/Australia) as its mesylate salt, imatinib mesilate (INN). It is occasionally referred to as CGP57148B or STI571 (especially in older publications). It is used in treating chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) and a number of other maligcies. Imatinib mesylate is a protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, the constitutive abnormal tyrosine kinase created by the Philadelphia chromosome abnormality in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). It inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in Bcr-Abl positive cell lines as well as fresh leukemic cells from Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia. Imatinib also inhibits the receptor tyrosine kinases for platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and stem cell factor (SCF) - called c-kit. Imatinib was identified in the late 1990s by Dr Brian J. Druker. Its development is an excellent example of rational drug design. Soon after identification of the bcr-abl target, the search for an inhibitor began. Chemists used a high-throughput screen of chemical libraries to identify the molecule 2-phenylaminopyrimidine. This lead compound was then tested and modified by the introduction of methyl and benzamide groups to give it enhanced binding properties, resulting in imatinib. 95% protein bound, mostly to albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein.  Imatinib is an antineoplastic agent and a 2-phenylaminopyrimidine derivative that is used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia. It works as a specific inhibitor of a number of tyrosine kinase enzymes. Chronic myelogenous leukemia is associated with the Philadelphia chromosome promoting the generation of BCR-ABL mutation, which results from the combination of two genes, known as BCR and ABL. BCR-ABL generates a fusion protein that acts as a constitutively active tyrosine kinase and imatinib works to inhibit this constitutive enzymatic activity.  For the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia (Ph+ CML), Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases, aggressive systemic mastocytosis, hypereosinophilic syndrome and/or chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, and maligt gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).\"\n",
      "Estrone_(14211),\"Estrone belongs to drug node. Estrone, one of the major mammalian estrogens, is an aromatized C18 steroid with a 3-hydroxyl group and a 17-ketone. It is produced in vivo from androstenedione or from testosterone via estradiol. It is produced primarily in the ovaries, placenta, and in peripheral tissues (especially adipose tissue) through conversion of adrostenedione. Estrone may be further metabolized to 16-alpha-hydroxyestrone, which may be reduced to estriol by estradiol dehydrogenase. Estrogens enter the cells of responsive tissues (e.g. female organs, breasts, hypothalamus, pituitary) where they interact with estrogen receptors. Hormone-bound estrogen receptors dimerize, translocate to the nucleus of cells and bind to estrogen response elements (ERE) of genes. Binding to ERE alters the transcription rate of affected genes. Estrogens increase the hepatic synthesis of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), and other serum proteins and suppress follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) release from the anterior pituitary. > 95% Estrone, a synthetically prepared or naturally occurring steroidal estrogen obtained from pregt equine urine, is the primary circulating estrogen after menopause. Estrone is naturally derived from the peripheral conversion of androstenedione by an aromatase enzyme found in adipose tissues and is converted to estradiol in peripheral tissues. The estrogenic potency of estrone is one third that of estradiol. Estropipate is piperazine-stabilized estrone sulfate. Estrone, and estropipate are used to treat abnormalities related to gonadotropin hormone dysfunction, vasomotor symptoms, atrophic vaginitis, and vulvar atrophy associated with menopause, and for the prevention of osteoporosis due to estrogen deficiency.

      "Verapamil_(14212),\"Verapamil belongs to drug node. Verapamil is a phenylalkylamine calcium channel blocker used in the treatment of high blood pressure, heart arrhythmias, and angina, and was the first calcium channel antagonist to be introduced into therapy in the early 1960s. It is a member of the non-dihydropyridine class of calcium channel blockers, which includes drugs like and , but is chemically unrelated to other cardioactive medications. Verapamil is administered as a racemic mixture containing equal amounts of the S- and R-etiomer, each of which is pharmacologically distinct - the S-etiomer carries approximately 20-fold greater potency than the R-etiomer, but is metabolized at a higher rate. Verapamil inhibits L-type calcium channels by binding to a specific area of their alpha-1 subunit,Cav1.2, which is highly expressed on L-type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle and myocardial tissue where these channels are responsible for the control of peripheral vascular resistance and heart contractility. Calcium influx through these channels allows for the propagation of action potentials necessary for the contraction of muscle tissue and the heart's electrical pacemaker activity. Verapamil binds to these channels in a voltage- and frequency-dependent manner, meaning affinity is increased 1) as vascular smooth muscle membrane potential is reduced, and 2) with excessive depolarizing stimulus.  Verapamil is extensively protein-bound in plasma. R-verapamil is 94% bound to serum albumin while S-verapamil is 88% bound. Additionally, R-verapamil is 92% bound to alpha-1 acid glycoprotein and S-verapamil is 86% bound. Verapamil is an L-type calcium channel blocker with antiarrhythmic, antianginal, and antihypertensive activity. Immediate-release verapamil has a relatively short duration of action, requiring dosing 3 to 4 times daily, but extended-release formulations are available that allow for once-daily dosing. As verapamil is a negative inotropic medication (i.e. it decreases the strength of myocardial contraction), it should not be used in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as the decrease in contractility caused by verapamil may increase the risk of exacerbating these pre-existing conditions. Verapamil is indicated in the treatment of vasopastic (i.e. Prinzmetal's) angina, unstable angina, and chronic stable angina. It is also indicated to treat hypertension, for the prophylaxis of repetitive paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, and in combination with digoxin to control ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Given intravenously, it is indicated for the treatment of various supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, including rapid conversion to sinus rhythm in patients with supraventricular tachycardia and for temporary control of ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.\"\n",
      "Tamoxifen_(14213),\"Tamoxifen belongs to drug node. Tamoxifen is a non-steroidal antiestrogen used to treat estrogen receptor positive breast cancers as well as prevent the incidence of breast cancer in high risk populations. Tamoxifen is used alone or as an adjuvant in these treatments. Tamoxifen may no longer be the preferred treatment for these types of cancers as patients generally have better survival, side effect profiles, and compliance with. Tamoxifen competitively inhibits estrogen binding to its receptor, which is critical for it's activity in breast cancer cells. Tamoxifen leads to a decrease in tumor growth factor α and insulin-like growth factor 1, and an increase in sex hormone binding globulin. The increase in sex hormon binding globulin limits the amount of freely available estradiol. These changes reduce levels of factors that stimulate tumor growth. The protein binding of tamoxifen in plasma is over 98% and mostly to serum albumin. Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that inhibits growth and promotes apoptosis in estrogen receptor positive tumors. It has a long duration of action as the active metabolite N-desmethyltamoxifen has a half life of approximately 2 weeks. It has a narrow therapeutic index as higher doses can lead to breathing difficulty or convulsions. Tamoxifen administration is also associated with an increased incidence of uterine maligcies. Tamoxifen is indicated to treat estrogen receptor positive metastatic breast cancer in adults, as an adjuvant in the treatment of early stage estrogen receptor positive breast cancer in adults, to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer after surgery and radiation in adult women with ductal carcinoma in situ.\"\n",

Losartan is available as losartan potassium oral tablets as well as a combination tablet of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide. Patients taking losartan should have their renal function and potassium levels monitored. Losartan was granted FDA approval on 14 April 1995. Losartan reversibly and competitively prevents angiotensin II binding to the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor in tissues like vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Losartan and its active metabolite bind the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor with 1000 times more affinity than they bind to the AT<sub>2</sub> receptor. The active metabolite of losartan is 10-40 times more potent by weight than unmetabolized losartan as an inhibitor of AT<sub>1</sub> and is a non-competitive inhibitor. Losartan's prevention of angiotensin II binding causes vascular smooth muscle relaxation, lowering blood pressure. Losartan is 98.6-98.8% protein bound and the active metabolite (E-3174) is 99.7% protein bound in serum. Losartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker used to treat hypertension, diabetic nephropathy, and to reduce the risk of stroke. Losartan has a long duration of action as it is given once daily. Patients taking losartan should be regularly monitored for hypotension, renal function, and potassium levels.

Found in various tissues and organisms, it often acts as an essential growth factor in some bacterial species. Spermine is associated with nucleic acids, particularly in viruses, and is thought to stabilize the helical structure. Spermine is derived from spermidine by spermine synthase. Spermine is a polyamine, a small organic cations that is absolutely required for eukaryotic cell growth. Spermine, is normally found in millimolar concentrations in the nucleus. Spermine functions directly as a free radical scavenger, and forms a variety of adducts that prevent oxidative damage to DNA. Oxidative damage to DNA by reactive oxygen species is a continual problem that cells must guard against to survive. Hence, spermine is a major natural intracellular compound capable of protecting DNA from free radical attack. Spermine is also implicated in the regulation of gene expression, the stabilization of chromatin, and the prevention of endonuclease-mediated DNA fragmentation.  Spermine is a polyamine. It is an organic molecule that is involved in cellular metabolism. For nutritional supplementation, also for treating dietary shortage or imbalance\"\n",
      "Propylthiouracil_(14640),\"Propylthiouracil belongs to drug node. A thiourea antithyroid agent. Propythiouracil inhibits the synthesis of thyroxine and inhibits the peripheral conversion of throxine to tri-iodothyronine. It is used in the treatment of hyperthyroidism. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopeoia, 30th ed, p534) Propylthiouracil binds to thyroid peroxidase and thereby inhibits the conversion of iodide to iodine. Thyroid peroxidase normally converts iodide to iodine (via hydrogen peroxide as a cofactor) and also catalyzes the incorporation of the resulting iodide molecule onto both the 3 and/or 5 positions of the phenol rings of tyrosines found in thyroglobulin. Thyroglobulin is degraded to produce thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3), which are the main hormones produced by the thyroid gland. Therefore propylthiouracil effectively inhibits the production of new thyroid hormones. 82% Propylthiouracil is a thiourea antithyroid agent. Grave's disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. It is an autoimmune disease where an individual's own antibodies attach to thyroid stimulating hormone receptors within cells of the thyroid gland and then trigger overproduction of thyroid hormone. The two thyroid hormones manufactured by the thyroid gland, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), are formed by combining iodine and a protein called thyroglobulin with the assistance of an enzyme called peroxidase. PTU inhibits iodine and peroxidase from their normal interactions with thyroglobulin to form T4 and T3. This action decreases thyroid hormone production. PTU also interferes with the conversion of T4 to T3, and, since T3 is more potent than T4, this also reduces the activity of thyroid hormones. The actions and use of propylthiouracil are similar to those of methimazole. Used to manage hyperthyroidism which is due to an overactive thyroid gland (Grave's disease).\"\n",
      "Dopamine_(14641),\"Dopamine belongs to drug node. One of the catecholamine neurotransmitters in the brain. It is derived from tyrosine and is the precursor to norepinephrine and epinephrine. Dopamine is a major transmitter in the extrapyramidal system of the brain, and important in regulating movement. A family of receptors (receptors, dopamine) mediate its action. Dopamine is a precursor to norepinephrine in noradrenergic nerves and is also a neurotransmitter in certain areas of the central nervous system. Dopamine produces positive chronotropic and inotropic effects on the myocardium, resulting in increased heart rate and cardiac contractility. This is accomplished directly by exerting an agonist action on beta-adrenoceptors and indirectly by causing release of norepinephrine from storage sites in sympathetic nerve endings. In the brain, dopamine actas as an agonist to the five dopamine receptor subtypes (D!, D2, D3, D4, D5). No information currently available on protein binding. Dopamine is a natural catecholamine formed by the decarboxylation of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA). It is a precursor to norepinephrine in noradrenergic nerves and is also a neurotransmitter in certain areas of the central nervous system, especially in the nigrostriatal tract, and in a few peripheral sympathetic nerves. Dopamine produces positive chronotropic and inotropic effects on the myocardium, resulting in increased heart rate and cardiac contractility. This is accomplished directly by exerting an agonist action on beta-adrenoceptors and indirectly by causing release of norepinephrine from storage sites in sympathetic nerve endings.

      "Capsaicin_(14643),\"Capsaicin belongs to drug node. Capsaicin is most often used as a topical analgesic and exists in many formulations of cream, liquid, and patch preparations of various strengths; however, it may also be found in some dietary supplements. Capsaicin is a naturally-occurring botanical irritant in chili peppers, synthetically derived for pharmaceutical formulations. The most recent capsaicin FDA approval was Qutenza, an 8% capsaicin patch dermal-delivery system, indicated for neuropathic pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia. Capsaicin has been shown to reduce the amount of substance P associated with inflammation - however this is not believed to be its main mechanism in the relief of pain. Capsaicin's mechanism of action is attributed to \\defunctionalization\\\"\" of nociceptor fibers by inducing a topical hypersensitivity reaction on the skin. This alteration in pain mechanisms is due to many of the following: temporary loss of membrane potential, inability to transport neurotrophic factors leading to altered phenotype, and reversible retraction of epidermal and dermal nerve fiber terminals. \"\"  Capsaicin is a TRPV1 receptor agonist. TRPV1 is a trans-membrane receptor-ion channel complex activated by temperatures higher than 43 degrees Celsius, pH lower than 6, and endogenous lipids. When activated by a combination of these factors, the channel can transiently open and initiate depolarization due to the influx of calcium and sodium ions. Because TRPV1 is commonly expressed in A-delta and mostly C fibers, depolarization results in action potentials which send impulses to the brain and spinal cord. These impulses result in capsaicin effects of warming, tingling, itching, stinging, or burning. Capsaicin also causes more persistent activation of these receptors compared to the environmental agonists, resulting in a loss of response to many sensory stimuli, described as \\defunctionalization\\\"\". Capsaicin is associated with many enzymatic, cytoskeletal, and osmotic changes, as well as disruption of mitochondrial respiration, impairing nociceptor function for extended periods of time. \"\" The capsaicin 8% patch is indicated in the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia. There are multiple topical capsaicin formulations available, including creams and solutions, indicated for temporary analgesia in muscle and join pain as well as neuropathic pain. \"\n",
      "Methionine_(14645),\"Methionine belongs to drug node. A sulfur containing essential amino acid that is important in many body functions. It is a chelating agent for heavy metals. The mechanism of the possible anti-hepatotoxic activity of L-methionine is not entirely clear. It is thought that metabolism of high doses of acetaminophen in the liver lead to decreased levels of hepatic glutathione and increased oxidative stress. L-methionine is a precursor to L-cysteine. L-cysteine itself may have antioxidant activity. L-cysteine is also a precursor to the antioxidant glutathione. Antioxidant activity of L-methionine and metabolites of L-methionine appear to account for its possible anti-hepatotoxic activity. Recent research suggests that methionine itself has free-radical scavenging activity by virtue of its sulfur, as well as its chelating ability.  L-Methionine is a principle supplier of sulfur which prevents disorders of the hair, skin and nails; helps lower cholesterol levels by increasing the liver's production of lecithin; reduces liver fat and protects the kidneys; a natural chelating agent for heavy metals; regulates the formation of ammonia and creates ammonia-free urine which reduces bladder irritation; influences hair follicles and promotes hair growth. L-methionine may protect against the toxic effects of hepatotoxins, such as acetaminophen. Methionine may have antioxidant activity. Used for protein synthesis including the formation of SAMe, L-homocysteine, L-cysteine, taurine, and sulfate.\"\n",
      "Dabigatran etexilate_(14650),\"Dabigatran etexilate belongs to drug node. Dabigatran etexilate is an oral prodrug that is hydrolyzed to the competitive and reversible direct thrombin inhibitor. Dabigatran etexilate may be used to decrease the risk of venous thromboembolic events in patients in whom anticoagulation therapy is indicated. In contrast to warfarin, because its anticoagulant effects are predictable, lab monitoring is not necessary. Dabigatran etexilate was approved by the FDA in 2010. Dabigatran is hydrolysed to the active dabigatran by an esterase which induces hydrolysis. Dabigatran and it's glucuronidated metabolites all share equal pharmacological activity. Dabigatran and its metabolites inhibit thrombin, a serine protease. This inhibition prevents the thrombin mediated conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, an early step in the coagulation cascade. With reduced conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, clotting time increases. Dabigatran is approximately 35% protein plasma bound. Dabigatran directly inhibits thrombin in a concentration-dependent, reversible, specific, and competitive manner which results in a prolongation of aPTT (partial thromboplastin time), ECT (Ecarin clotting time), and TT (thrombin time). Dabigatran is indicated for the prevention of venous thromboembolic events in patients who have undergone elective hip or knee replacement surgery (based on RE-NOVATE, RE-MODEL, and RE-MOBILIZE trials). In 2010, it was approved in the US and Canada for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation (approval based on the RE-LY trial).\"\n",
      "Choline_(14653),\"Choline belongs to drug node. A basic constituent of lecithin that is found in many plants and animal organs. It is important as a precursor of acetylcholine, as a methyl donor in various metabolic processes, and in lipid metabolism. Choline is a major part of the polar head group of phosphatidylcholine. Phosphatidylcholine's role in the maintece of cell membrane integrity is vital to all of the basic biological processes: information flow, intracellular communication and bioenergetics. Inadequate choline intake would negatively affect all these processes. Choline is also a major part of another membrane phospholipid, sphingomyelin, also important for the maintece of cell structure and function. It is noteworthy and not surprising that choline deficiency in cell culture causes apoptosis or programmed cell death. This appears to be due to abnormalities in cell membrane phosphatidylcholine content and an increase in ceramide, a precursor, as well as a metabolite, of sphingomyelin. Ceramide accumulation, which is caused by choline deficiency, appears to activate Caspase, a type of enzyme that mediates apoptosis. Betaine or trimethylglycine is derived from choline via an oxidation reaction. Betaine is one of the factors that maintains low levels of homocysteine by resynthesizing L-methionine from homocysteine. Elevated homocysteine levels are a significant risk factor for atherosclerosis, as well as other cardiovascular and neurological disorders. Acetylcholine is one of the major neurotransmitters and requires choline for its synthesis. Adequate acetylcholine levels in the brain are believed to be protective against certain types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease.  This compound is needed for good nerve conduction throughout the CNS (central nervous system) as it is a precursor to acetylcholine (ACh). Choline is also needed for gallbladder regulation, liver function and lecithin (a key lipid) formation. Choline also aids in fat and cholesterol metabolism and prevents excessive fat build up in the liver. Choline has been used to mitigate the effects of Parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia. Choline deficiencies may result in excessive build-up of fat in the liver, high blood pressure, gastric ulcers, kidney and liver dysfunction and stunted growth. For nutritional supplementation, also for treating dietary shortage or imbalance\"\n",

      "Cannabidiol_(14656),\"Cannabidiol belongs to drug node. Cannabidiol, or CBD, is one of at least 85 active cannabinoids identified within the Cannabis plant. It is a major phytocannabinoid, accounting for up to 40% of the Cannabis plant's extract, that binds to a wide variety of physiological targets of the endocannabinoid system within the body. Although the exact medical implications are currently being investigated, CBD has shown promise as a therapeutic and pharmaceutical drug target. In particular, CBD has shown promise as an analgesic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, anxiolytic, antipsychotic and has shown neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activity, among other currently investigated uses. CBD's exact place within medical practice is still currently hotly debated, however as the body of evidence grows and legislation changes to reflect its wide-spread use, public and medical opinion have changed significantly with regards to its usefulness in a number of medical conditions ranging from anxiety to epilepsy. The exact mechanism of action of CBD and THC is not currently fully understood. However, it is known that CBD acts on cannabinoid (CB) receptors of the endocannabinoid system, which are found in numerous areas of the body, including the peripheral and central nervous systems, including the brain. The endocannabinoid system regulates many physiological responses of the body including pain, memory, appetite, and mood. More specifically, CB1 receptors can be found within the pain pathways of the brain and spinal cord where they may affect CBD-induced analgesia and anxiolysis, and CB2 receptors have an effect on immune cells, where they may affect CBD-induced anti-inflammatory processes.   Although the exact mechanism and magnitude of effects of THC and CBD are not fully understood, CBD has been shown to have analgesic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, anxiolytic, neuroprotective, anti-oxidant, and anti-psychotic activity. This wide variety of effects is likely due to it's complex pharmacological mechanisms. In addition to binding to CB1 and CB2 receptors of the endocannabinoid system, there is evidence that CBD activates 5-HT1A serotonergic and TRPV1–2 vanilloid receptors, antagonizes alpha-1 adrenergic and µ-opioid receptors, inhibits synaptosomal uptake of noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin and gaminobutyric acid and cellular uptake of adamide, acts on mitochondria Ca2 stores, blocks low-voltage-activated (T-type) Ca2 channels, stimulates activity of the inhibitory glycine-receptor, and inhibits activity of fatty amide hydrolase (FAAH). When used in combination with delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol as the product Sativex, cannabidiol was given a standard marketing authorization (ie. a Notice of Compliance (NOC)) by Health Canada for the following indications: \"\n",
      "Nabiximols_(14661),\"Nabiximols belongs to drug node. Nabiximols (tradename Sativex®) is a whole plant extract from the Cannabis species _Cannabis sativa L._ that has been purified into the active components CBD (cannabidiol) and THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol). For trademark purposes, purified CBD is branded as Nabidiolex®, while THC is purified as the product Tetrabinex®. Sativex® is available in a 1:1 formulation of THC:CBD as an oro-mucosal pump spray used for treatment of neuropathic pain from Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and for intractable cancer pain. Although still largely debated, Cannabis has been shown to have analgesic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, anxiolytic, neuroprotective, anti-oxidant, and anti-psychotic activity.  The primary psychoactive component of Cannabis, delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), demonstrates its effects through weak partial agonist activity at Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors. This activity results in the well-known effects of smoking cannabis such as increased appetite, reduced pain, and changes in emotional and cognitive processes. In contrast to THC's weak agonist activity, CBD has been shown to act as a negative allosteric modulator of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor, the most abundant G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) in the body. Allosteric regulation is achieved through the modulation of receptor activity on a functionally distinct site from the agonist or antagonist binding site. The negative allosteric modulatory effects of CBD are therapeutically important as direct agonists are limited by their psychomimetic effects while direct antagonists are limited by their depressant effects.   The principal pharmacological effects of THC include analgesic, muscle relaxant, antiemetic, appetite stimulant and psychoactive effects. CBD has analgesic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, anxiolytic, neuroprotective, anti-oxidant and anti-psychotic activity.  In Canada, Sativex has received a Notice of Compliance (NOC) for use as an as adjunctive treatment for symptomatic relief of spasticity in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who have not responded adequately to other therapy and who demonstrate meaningful improvement during an initial trial of therapy. \"\n",
      "Folic acid_(14678),\"Folic acid belongs to drug node. Folic acid, also known as folate or Vitamin B9, is a member of the B vitamin family and an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in DNA and RNA synthesis. More specifically, folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. Folic acid is particularly important during phases of rapid cell division, such as infancy, pregcy, and erythropoiesis, and plays a protective factor in the development of cancer. As humans are unable to synthesize folic acid endogenously, diet and supplementation is necessary to prevent deficiencies. For example, folic acid is present in green vegetables, beans, avocado, and some fruits. Folic acid, as it is biochemically inactive, is converted to tetrahydrofolic acid and methyltetrahydrofolate by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). These folic acid congeners are transported across cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis where they are needed to maintain normal erythropoiesis, synthesize purine and thymidylate nucleic acids, interconvert amino acids, methylate tRNA, and generate and use formate. Using vitamin B12 as a cofactor, folic acid can normalize high homocysteine levels by remethylation of homocysteine to methionine via methionine synthetase. Very high to plasma protein Folic acid is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin found in foods such as liver, kidney, yeast, and leafy, green vegetables. Also known as folate or Vitamin B9, folic acid is an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in DNA and RNA synthesis. More specifically, folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. Folic acid is the precursor of tetrahydrofolic acid, which is involved as a cofactor for transformylation reactions in the biosynthesis of purines and thymidylates of nucleic acids. Impairment of thymidylate synthesis in patients with folic acid deficiency is thought to account for the defective deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis that leads to megaloblast formation and megaloblastic and macrocytic anemias. Folic acid is particularly important during phases of rapid cell division, such as infancy, pregcy, and erythropoiesis, and plays a protective factor in the development of cancer. As humans are unable to synthesize folic acid endogenously, diet and supplementation is necessary to prevent deficiencies. In order to function properly within the body, folic acid must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted by anti-metabolite therapies such as as they function as DHFR inhibitors to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, and therefore prevent the formation of DHF and THF.  Folic acid is indicated for the treatment of folic acid deficiency, megaloblastic anemia, and in anemias of nutritional origins, pregcy, infancy, or childhood.\"\n",

      "Clomifene_(14686),\"Clomifene belongs to drug node. A triphenyl ethylene stilbene derivative which is an estrogen agonist or antagonist depending on the target tissue. Clomifene has both estrogenic and anti-estrogenic properties, but its precise mechanism of action has not been determined. Clomifene appears to stumulate the release of gonadotropins, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and leuteinizing hormone (LH), which leads to the development and maturation of ovarian follicle, ovulation, and subsequent development and function of the coprus luteum, thus resulting in pregcy. Gonadotropin release may result from direct stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis or from a decreased inhibitory influence of estrogens on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis by competing with the endogenous estrogens of the uterus, pituitary, or hypothalamus. Clomifene has no apparent progestational, androgenic, or antrandrogenic effects and does not appear to interfere with pituitary-adrenal or pituitary-thyroid function.  Clomifene (previously clomiphene) is an orally administered, non steroidal, ovulatory stimulant that acts as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Clomifene can lead to multiple ovulation, and hence increase the risk of conceiving twins. In comparison to purified FSH, the rate of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is low. There may be an increased risk of ovarian cancer and weight gain. Clomifene is capable of interacting with estrogen-receptor-containing tissues, including the hypothalamus, pituitary, ovary, endometrium, vagina, and cervix. It may compete with estrogen for estrogen-receptor-binding sites and may delay replenishment of intracellular estrogen receptors. Clomifene initiates a series of endocrine events culminating in a preovulatory gonadotropin surge and subsequent follicular rupture. The first endocrine event, in response to a course of clomifene therapy, is an increase in the release of pituitary gonadotropins. This initiates steroidogenesis and folliculogenesis resulting in growth of the ovarian follicle and an increase in the circulating level of estradiol. Following ovulation, plasma progesterone and estradiol rise and fall as they would in a normal ovulatory cycle. Used mainly in female infertility due to anovulation (e.g. due to polycystic ovary syndrome) to induce ovulation. \"\n",

A hormone secreted by the adrenal cortex that regulates electrolyte and water balance by increasing the renal retention of sodium and the excretion of potassium.   At the late distal tubule and collecting duct, aldosterone has two main actions: 1) aldosterone acts on mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) on principal cells in the distal tubule of the kidney nephron, increasing the permeability of their apical (luminal) membrane to potassium and sodium and activates their basolateral Na+/K+ pumps, stimulating ATP hydrolysis leading to phosphorylation of the pump and a conformational change in the pump exposes the Na+ ions to the outside. The phosphorylated form of the pump has a low affinity for Na+ ions, hence reabsorbing sodium (Na+) ions and water into the blood, and secreting potassium (K+) ions into the urine; 2) aldosterone stimulates H+ secretion by intercalated cells in the collecting duct, regulating plasma bicarbonate (HCO3−) levels and its acid/base balance; and 3) aldosterone may act on the central nervous system via the posterior pituitary gland to release vasopressin (ADH) which serves to conserve water by direct actions on renal tubular resorption. \"\n",

Meperidine is primarily a kappa-opiate receptor agonist and also has local anesthetic effects. Meperidine has more affinity for the kappa-receptor than morphine. Opiate receptors are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as both positive and negative regulators of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin and glucagon. Opioids close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP2-receptor agonist) and open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels (OP3 and OP1 receptor agonist). This results in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability. 60-80% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin and &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-acid glycoprotein. The presence of cirrhosis or active viral hepatitis does not appear to affect the extent of protein binding.  Meperidine is a synthetic opiate agonist belonging to the phenylpiperidine class. Meperidine may produce less smooth muscle spasm, constipation, and depression of the cough reflex than equivalent doses of morphine. The onset of action is lightly more rapid than with morphine, and the duration of action is slightly shorter. The chemical structure of meperidine is similar to local anesthetics. Meperidine is recommended for relief of moderate to severe acute pain and has the unique ability to interrupt postoperative shivering and shaking chills induced by amphotericin B. Meperidine has also been used for intravenous regional anesthesia, peripheral nerve blocks and intraarticular, epidural and spinal analgesia. Meperidine is considered a second-line agent for the treatment of acute pain. Used to control moderate to severe pain.\"\n",
      "Cefalotin_(14172),\"Cefalotin belongs to drug node. Cefalotin is a cephalosporin antibiotic. The bactericidal activity of cefalotin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis via affinity for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). The PBPs are transpeptidases which are vital in peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Therefore, their inhibition prevents this vital cell wall compenent from being properly synthesized. 65-80% Cefalotin (INN) or cephalothin (USAN) is a semisynthetic first generation cephalosporin having a broad spectrum of antibiotic activity that is administered parenterally. Used to prevent infection during surgery and to treat many kinds of infections of the blood, bone or joints, respiratory tract, skin, and urinary tract.\"\n",
      "Imipramine_(14173),\"Imipramine belongs to drug node. Imipramine, the prototypical tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), is a dibenzazepine-derivative TCA. TCAs are structurally similar to phenothiazines. They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, imipramine does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, imipramine exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Tertiary amine TCAs, such as imipramine and amitriptyline, are more potent inhibitors of serotonin reuptake than secondary amine TCAs, such as nortriptyline and desipramine. TCAs also block histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptors, &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively. Imipramine has less sedative and anticholinergic effects than the tertiary amine TCAs, amitriptyline and clomipramine. Imipramine may be used to treat depression and nocturnal enuresis in children. Unlabeled indications include chronic and neuropathic pain (including diabetic neuropathy), panic disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Imipramine works by inhibiting the neuronal reuptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin. It binds the sodium-dependent serotonin transporter and sodium-dependent norepinephrine transporter reducing the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin by neurons. Depression has been linked to a lack of stimulation of the post-synaptic neuron by norepinephrine and serotonin. Slowing the reuptake of these neurotransmitters increases their concentration in the synaptic cleft, producing knock-on effects in protein kinase signalling which is thought to contribute to changes in neurotransmission and brain physiology which relieves symptoms of depression.  Imipramine is 60-96% bound to plasma proteins in circulation. It is known to bind albumin, α1-acid glycoprotein, and lipoproteins. Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant with general pharmacological properties similar to those of structurally related tricyclic antidepressant drugs such as amitriptyline and doxepin. While it acts to block both, imipramine displays a much higher affinity for the serotonin reuptake transporter than for the norepinephrine reuptake transporter. Imipramine produces effects similar to other monoamine targeting antidepressants, increasing serotonin- and norepinephrine-based neurotransmission. For the relief of symptoms of depression and as temporary adjunctive therapy in reducing enuresis in children aged 6 years and older. \"\n",
      "Nabumetone_(14175),\"Nabumetone belongs to drug node. Nabumetone was originally developed as a non-acidic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It was thought to avoid trapping of the drug in the stomach by making it unable to dissociate into ions which was believed to reduce GI toxicity by limiting local action. While slightly reduced, possibly due to a degree of cyclooxygenase-2 selectivity (COX-2), nabumetone still produces significant adverse effects in the GI tract. The molecule itself is a pro-drug with its 6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid (6-MNA) metabolite acting as a potent COX inhibitor similar in structure to. Nabumetone was developed by Smithkline Beecham under the trade name Relafen and first received FDA approval in December, 1991. Nabumetone's active metabolite, 6-MNA, is an inhibitor of both COX-1 and COX-2 although it exhibits some COX-2 selectivity. Inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 reduces conversion of arachidonic acid to PGs and thromboxane (TXA<sub>2</sub>). This reduction in prostanoid production is the common mechanism that mediates the effects of nambutone. 6-MNA is over 99% bound to plasma proteins, likely albumin. The unbound fraction is 0.1-0.2% and remains proportional in the dose range of 1000-2000mg NSAIDs, like nabumetone, are well established as analgesics. NSAIDs reduce both peripheral and central sensitization of nociceptive neurons due to inflammation which contribute to hyperalgesia and allodynia. This sensitization occurs through reducing the action potential threshold in peripheral neurons, reducing the intensity of painful stimuli needed to produce a painful sensation. Centrally, activation of dorsal horn neurons occurs along with increased release of glutamate, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and substance P which increase the transmission of painful stimuli. Coupled with this is an inhibition glycinergic neurons which normally inhibit pain transmission, a phenomenon known as disinhibition. Increased activity ofn-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors leads to the establishment of central sensitization, allowing both mild painful and innocuous stimuli to produce action potentials in nociceptive projection neurons. NSAIDs are effective in reducing mild-moderate acute and chronic nociceptive pain, however, the usefulness of NSAIDs in neuropathic pain is limited. **Indicated** for:\"\n",
      "Fluoxetine_(14176),\"Fluoxetine belongs to drug node. Fluoxetine is a 2nd generation antidepressant categorized as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). It gained FDA approval in 1987 and although it was initially intended for the treatment of depression, today it is commonly prescribed to manage depression in addition to various other pathologies. The monoaminergic hypothesis of depression emerged in 1965 and linked depression with dysfunction of neurotransmitters such as noradrenaline and serotonin. Indeed, low levels of serotonin have been observed in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients diagnosed with depression. As a result of this hypothesis, drugs that modulate levels of serotonin such as fluoxetine were developed. Approximately 94% of fluoxetine is plasma protein bound. Fluoxetine blocks the serotonin reuptake transporter in the presynaptic terminal, which ultimately results in sustained levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in certain brain areas. However, fluoxetine binds with relatively poor affinity to 5-HT, dopaminergic, adrenergic, cholinergic, muscarinic, and histamine receptors which explains why it has a far more desirable adverse effect profile compared to earlier developed classes of antidepressants such as tricyclic antidepressants.  Fluoxetine is indicated for both acute and maintece treatment of major depressive disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and bulimia nervosa; however, it is only indicated for acute treatment of panic disorder independent of whether agoraphobia is present. Fluoxetine may also be used in combination with olanzapine to treat depression related to Bipolar I Disorder, and treatment resistant depression.\"\n",
      "Duloxetine_(14177),\"Duloxetine belongs to drug node. Duloxetine is a dual serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. It was originally discovered in 1993 and developed by Eli Lilly and Company as LY248686. Duloxetine first received approval from the FDA in August, 2004 as Cymbalta for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder. It has since received approval for a variety of indications including the treatment of neuropathic pain, Generalized Anxiety disorder, osteoarthritis, and stress incontinence. Duloxetine continues to be investigated for the treatment of pain in cancer, surgery, and more. Duloxetine is a potent inhibitor of neuronal serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and a less potent inhibitor of dopamine reuptake. Duloxetine has no significant affinity for dopaminergic, adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, opioid, glutamate, and GABA receptors. Over 90% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin and α1 acid-glycoprotein. Duloxetine, through increasing serotonin and norepinephrine concentrations in Onuf's nucleus, enhances glutamatergic activation of the pudendal motor nerve which innervates the external urethral sphinter. This enhanced signaling allows for stronger contraction. Increased contraction of this sphincter increases the pressure needed to produce an incontinence episode in stress urinary incontinence. Duloxetine has been shown to improve Patient Global Impression of Improvement and Incontinence Quality of Life scores. It has also been shown to reduce the median incontinence episode frequency at doses of 40 and 80 mg. **Indicated** for:\"\n",
      "Chlorpromazine_(14178),\"Chlorpromazine belongs to drug node. The prototypical phenothiazine antipsychotic drug. Like the other drugs in this class, chlorpromazine's antipsychotic actions are thought to be due to long-term adaptation by the brain to blocking dopamine receptors. Chlorpromazine has several other actions and therapeutic uses, including as an antiemetic and in the treatment of intractable hiccup. Chlorpromazine acts as an antagonist (blocking agent) on different postsysnaptic receptors -on dopaminergic-receptors (subtypes D1, D2, D3 and D4 - different antipsychotic properties on productive and unproductive symptoms), on serotonergic-receptors (5-HT1 and 5-HT2, with anxiolytic, antidepressive and antiaggressive properties as well as an attenuation of extrapypramidal side-effects, but also leading to weight gain, fall in blood pressure, sedation and ejaculation difficulties), on histaminergic-receptors (H1-receptors, sedation, antiemesis, vertigo, fall in blood pressure and weight gain), alpha1/alpha2-receptors (antisympathomimetic properties, lowering of blood pressure, reflex tachycardia, vertigo, sedation, hypersalivation and incontinence as well as sexual dysfunction, but may also attenuate pseudoparkinsonism - controversial) and finally on muscarinic (cholinergic) M1/M2-receptors (causing anticholinergic symptoms like dry mouth, blurred vision, obstipation, difficulty/inability to urinate, sinus tachycardia, ECG-changes and loss of memory, but the anticholinergic action may attenuate extrapyramidal side-effects). > 90% to plasma proteins, primarily albumin Chlorpromazine is a psychotropic agent indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia. It also exerts sedative and antiemetic activity. Chlorpromazine has actions at all levels of the central nervous system-primarily at subcortical levels-as well as on multiple organ systems. Chlorpromazine has strong antiadrenergic and weaker peripheral anticholinergic activity; ganglionic blocking action is relatively slight. It also possesses slight antihistaminic and antiserotonin activity. For the treatment of schizophrenia; to control nausea and vomiting; for relief of restlessness and apprehension before surgery; for acute intermittent porphyria; as an adjunct in the treatment of tetanus; to control the manifestations of the manic type of manic-depressive illness; for relief of intractable hiccups; for the treatment of severe behavioral problems in children (1 to 12 years of age) marked by combativeness and/or explosive hyperexcitable behavior (out of proportion to immediate provocations), and in the short-term treatment of hyperactive children who show excessive motor activity with accompanying conduct disorders consisting of some or all of the following symptoms: impulsivity, difficulty sustaining attention, aggressivity, mood lability, and poor frustration tolerance.\"\n",
      "Raloxifene_(14179),\"Raloxifene belongs to drug node. Raloxifene is a second generation selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that mediates anti-estrogenic effects on breast and uterine tissues, and estrogenic effects on bone, lipid metabolism, and blood coagulation. Exhibiting tissue-specific effects distinct from , raloxifene is the first of the benzothiophene group of antiestrogens to be labelled a SERM. Available in many countries worldwide, raloxifene was initially approved by the FDA in December, 1997 under the market name Evista® for the management and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and reduction in risk for invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis or those who are at high risk for invasive breast cancer. However, it has a negligible effect on altering the development and progression of breast cancer itself. The most common causes of osteoporosis include postmenopausal deficiency of estrogen and age-related deterioration in bone homeostasis. Due to the risk of bone fractures that may lead to morbidities and reduced quality of life, the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women with the use of therapeutic agents in addition to concurrent therapies is critical. Due to the decline in estrogen levels in postmenopausal osteoporosis, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), such as estradiol, has been used to ameliorate the condition. However, due to the off-target actions by HRT, newer non-hormonal agents such as raloxifene and have been developed to reduce adverse events through selective pharmacological actions on tissue-specific therapeutic targets. Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that acts as both an estrogen agonist and antagonist via differential effects on the tissue-specific estrogen receptors. Based on the findings of competitive binding assays, raloxifene displays binding affinity that is similar to that of , the predomit circulating estrogen. Estrogens play variable roles at different tissues in females, including the bone, breasts, uterus and liver, by binding to the steroid nuclear hormone receptors, Estrogen Receptor alpha (ERα) or Estrogen Receptor beta (ERβ). These receptors are normally bound to the Heat Shock Protein 90 (Hsp90) when unbound to the ligand. Ligand binding induces a conformational change in the receptor that promotes dissociation of the receptor from Hsp90, dimerization and translocation into the nucleus. This movement into the nucleus allows the receptor to bind to genomic locations based on sequence recognition of the DNA binding domain, also known as the Estrogen Response Elements (EREs).  About 95% of raloxifene and its glucuronide metabolites are bound to plasma proteins. Although this is a relatively high protein binding profile, _in vitro_ studies suggest that raloxifene and its metabolites do not significantly interact with binding of highly protein-bound drugs. FDA Label still advises patients to use raloxifene with caution co-administering with other highly protein-bound drugs. Raloxifene belongs to the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) drug class that exhibits estrogenic effects on bone and lipid metabolism while mediating anti-estrogenic effects on uterine endometrium and breast tissues. On skeletal tissues, raloxifene stimulates bone-depositing osteoblasts and inhibits bone-resorbing osteoclasts to augument bone mineral density. Raloxifene produces estrogen-like effects on bone, reducing the resorption of bone and increasing bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, thus slowing the rate of bone loss. In three randomized, placebo-controlled trials in Europe, postmenopausal women receiving raloxifene at variable doses of 30 to 150 mg daily demonstrated significant increases in bone mineral density in the lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck and total body compared to placebo. In the MORE and RUTH trials, there were fewer incidences of vertebral fractures in postmeopausal women receiving raloxifene compared to placebo. In a eight-week study evaluating short-term effects of raloxifene in healthy postmenopausal women, there was a decrease in the bone turnover markers, such as serum alkaline phosphatase level, serum osteocalcin level and urinary calcium excretion.  Indicated for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, as well as prevention and treatment of corticosteroid-induced bone loss.\"\n",
      "Buspirone_(14180),\"Buspirone belongs to drug node. Buspirone is a novel anxiolytic agent with a unique structure and a pharmacological profile. Belonging to the azaspirodecanedione drug class, buspirone is a serotonin 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor agonist that is not chemically or pharmacologically related to benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and other sedative/anxiolytic drugs. Unlike many drugs used to treat anxiety, buspirone does not exhibit anticonvulsant, sedative, hypnotic, and muscle-relaxant properties. Due to these characteristics, buspirone been termed 'anxioselective'. First synthesized in 1968 then patented in 1975, it is commonly marketed under the brand name Buspar®. Buspirone was first approved in 1986 by the FDA and has been used to treat anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and relieve symptoms of anxiety. It has also been used as a second-line therapy for unipolar depression when the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is deemed clinically inadequate or inappropriate. The potential use of buspirone in combination with in depression and cognitive impairment via promoting neurogenesis has also been investigated. The therapeutic action of buspirone in generalized anxiety disorders is thought to be mainly derived from its interaction with two major 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor subtypes that are involved in the brain's anxiety and fear circuitry to enhance the serotonergic activity in these brain areas. Buspirone acts as a full agonist at presynaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors, or 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptors, expressed at dorsal raphe while acting as a partial agonist at the postsynaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors expressed on hippocampus and cortex. 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors function as inhibitory autoreceptors by being expressed on the soma or dendrites of serotonergic neurons or mediate postsynaptic actions of 5-HT by being highly expressed on the corticolimbic circuits. They are inhibitory G-protein coupled receptors that couple to Gi/Go proteins. When activated, presynaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptors causes neuron hyperpolarization and reduces the firing rate of the serotonergic neuron, thereby decreasing extracellular 5-HT levels in the neuron's projection areas. Activated postsynaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors promote hyperpolarization to released 5-HT on pyramidal neurons.  Based on the findings of an _in vitro_ protein binding study, approximately 86% of buspirone is bound to plasma proteins. It is mainly bound to serum albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. The clinical effect of buspirone in alleviating the symptoms of generalized anxiety disorders typically takes 2 to 4 weeks to achieve. The delayed onset of action of buspirone suggests that the therapeutic effectiveness in generalized anxiety may involved more than its molecular mechanism of action at the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors, or buspirone may induce adaptations of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors. Buspirone was not shown to alter the psychomotor or cognitive function in healthy volunteers, and the risk of developing sedation is relatively low compared to other anxiolytics, such as benzodiazepines. Unlike benzodiazepines and barbiturates used in anxiety disorders, buspirone is not associated with a risk for developing physical dependence or withdrawal, or any significant interaction with central nervous system depressants such as ethanol. This is due to the lack of effects on GABA receptors. Buspirone also does not exhibit any anticonvulsant or muscle-relaxing properties, but may interfere with arousal reactions due to its inhibitory action on the aactivity of noradrenergic locus coerulus neurons. Indicated for the management of anxiety disorders or the short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety.\"\n",
      "Zidovudine_(14181),\"Zidovudine belongs to drug node. A dideoxynucleoside compound in which the 3&#39;-hydroxy group on the sugar moiety has been replaced by an azido group. This modification prevents the formation of phosphodiester linkages which are needed for the completion of nucleic acid chains. The compound is a potent inhibitor of HIV replication, acting as a chain-terminator of viral DNA during reverse transcription. It improves immunologic function, partially reverses the HIV-induced neurological dysfunction, and improves certain other clinical abnormalities associated with AIDS. Its principal toxic effect is dose-dependent suppression of bone marrow, resulting in anemia and leukopenia.  Zidovudine, a structural analog of thymidine, is a prodrug that must be phosphorylated to its active 5′-triphosphate metabolite, zidovudine triphosphate (ZDV-TP). It inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) via DNA chain termination after incorporation of the nucleotide analogue. It competes with the natural substrate dGTP and incorporates itself into viral DNA. It is also a weak inhibitor of cellular DNA polymerase α and γ.  30-38% Zidovudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) with activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). Zidovudine is phosphorylated to active metabolites that compete for incorporation into viral DNA. They inhibit the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme competitively and act as a chain terminator of DNA synthesis. The lack of a 3'-OH group in the incorporated nucleoside analogue prevents the formation of the 5' to 3' phosphodiester linkage essential for DNA chain elongation, and therefore, the viral DNA growth is terminated. Used in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of human immunovirus (HIV) infections.\"\n",
      "Tolmetin_(14183),\"Tolmetin belongs to drug node. A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (anti-inflammatory agents, NON-steroidal) similar in mode of action to indomethacin. The mode of action of tolmetin is not known. However, studies in laboratory animals and man have demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory action of tolmetin is not due to pituitary-adrenal stimulation. Tolmetin inhibits prostaglandin synthetase in vitro and lowers the plasma level of prostaglandin E in man. This reduction in prostaglandin synthesis may be responsible for the anti-inflammatory action. Tolmetin does not appear to alter the course of the underlying disease in man.  Tolmetin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent. Studies in animals have shown tolmetin to possess anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activity. In the rat, tolmetin prevents the development of experimentally induced polyarthritis and also decreases established inflammation. In patients with either rheumatoid arthritis or osteaoarthritis, tolmetin is as effective as aspirin and indomethacin in controlling disease activity, but the frequency of the milder gastrointestinal adverse effects and tinnitus was less than in aspirin-treated patients, and the incidence of central nervous system adverse effects was less than in indomethacin-treated patients. In patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, tolmetin is as effective as aspirin in controlling disease activity, with a similar incidence of adverse reactions. tolmetin has produced additional therapeutic benefit when added to a regimen of gold salts and, to a lesser extent, with corticosteroids. Tolmetin should not be used in conjunction with salicylates since greater benefit from the combination is not likely, but the potential for adverse reactions is increased. For the relief of signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, including the treatment of acute flares long-term management. Also for treatment of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.\"\n",
      "Ritonavir_(14184),\"Ritonavir belongs to drug node. Ritonavir is an HIV protease inhibitor that interferes with the reproductive cycle of HIV. Although it was initially developed as an independent antiviral agent, it has been shown to possess advantageous properties in combination regimens with low-dose ritonavir and other protease inhibitors. It is now more commonly used as a booster of other protease inhibitors and is available in both liquid formulation and as capsules.  Ritonavic inhibits the HIV viral proteinase enzyme that normally cleaves the structural and replicative proteins that arise from major HIV genes, such as *gag* and *pol*. *Gag* encodes proteins involved in the core and the nucleocapsid, while *pol* encodes the the HIV reverse transcriptase, ribonuclease H, integrase, and protease. The *pol*-encoded proteins are initially translated in the form of a larger precursoe polypeptide, *gag-pol*, and needs to be cleaved by HIV protease to form other complement proteins. Ritonavir prevents the cleavage of the *gag-pol* polyprotein, which results in noninfectious, immature viral particles. Ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 isoenzyme present both in the intestinal tract and liver. It is a type II ligand that perfectly fits into the CYP3A4 active site cavity and irreversibly binds to the heme iron via the thiazole nitrogen, which decreases the redox potential of the protein and precludes its reduction with the redox partner, cytochrome P450 reductase. Ritonavir may also play a role in limiting cellular transport and efflux of other protease inhibitors via the P-glycoprotein and MRP efflux channels. Ritonavir is highly protein-bound in plasma (~98-99%), primarily to albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein over the standard concentration range. Ritonavir is a protease inhibitor with activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). Protease inhibitors block the part of HIV called protease. HIV-1 protease is an enzyme required for the proteolytic cleavage of the viral polyprotein precursors into the individual functional proteins found in infectious HIV-1. Ritonavir binds to the protease active site and inhibits the activity of the enzyme. This inhibition prevents cleavage of the viral polyproteins resulting in the formation of immature non-infectious viral particles. Protease inhibitors are almost always used in combination with at least two other anti-HIV drugs. Modern protease inhibitors require the use of low-dose ritonavir to boost pharmacokinetic exposure through inhibition of metabolism via the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme pathway.  Indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.\"\n",
      "Erlotinib_(14187),\"Erlotinib belongs to drug node. Erlotinib is an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase that is used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer and several other types of cancer. It is typically marketed under the trade name Tarceva. Erlotinib binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase in a reversible fashion at the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site of the receptor. Recent studies demonstrate that erlotinib is also a potent inhibitor of JAK2V617F, which is a mutant form of tyrosine kinase JAK2 found in most patients with polycythemia vera (PV) and a substantial proportion of patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis or essential thrombocythemia. This finding introduces the potential use of erlotinib in the treatment of JAK2V617F-positive PV and other myeloproliferative disorders. The mechanism of clinical antitumor action of erlotinib is not fully characterized. Erlotinib inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of tyrosine kinase associated with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Specificity of inhibition with regard to other tyrosine kinase receptors has not been fully characterized.

It is formulated for oral, intravenous, intratympanic, ophthalmic, and otic administration for a number of bacterial infections. Ciprofloxacin acts on bacterial topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV. Ciprofloxacin's targeting of the alpha subunits of DNA gyrase prevents it from supercoiling the bacterial DNA which prevents DNA replication. 20-40%. Ciprofloxacin is a second generation fluoroquinolone that is active against many Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria. It produces its action through inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Ciprofloxacin binds to bacterial DNA gyrase with 100 times the affinity of mammalian DNA gyrase. There is no cross resistance between fluoroquinolones and other classes of antibiotics, so it may be of clinical value when other antibiotics are no longer effective. Ciprofloxain and its derivatives are also being investigated for its action against malaria, cancers, and AIDS. Ciprofloxacin is only indicated in infections caused by susceptible bacteria.\"\n",
      "Nortriptyline_(14189),\"Nortriptyline belongs to drug node. Nortriptyline hydrochloride, the active metabolite of , is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). It is used in the treatment of major depression and is also used off-label for chronic pain and other conditions. Though prescribing information does not identify a specific mechanism of action for nortriptyline, is believed that nortriptyline either inhibits the reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin at the neuronal membrane or acts at the level of the beta-adrenergic receptors. It displays a more selective reuptake inhibition for noradrenaline, which may explain increased symptom improvement after nortriptyline therapy. Tricyclic antidepressants do not inhibit monoamine oxidase nor do they affect dopamine reuptake. As with other tricyclics, nortriptyline displays affinity for other receptors including mACh receptors, histamine receptors, 5-HT receptors, in addition to other receptors.  The plasma protein binding of nortriptyline is approximately 93%. Nortriptyline exerts antidepressant effects likely by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine at neuronal cell membranes. It also exerts antimuscarinic effects through its actions on the acetylcholine receptor. Nortriptyline is indicated for the relief of the symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD). Some off-label uses for this drug include treatment of chronic pain, myofascial pain, neuralgia, and irritable bowel syndrome.\"\n",

It is indicated to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism (SE) in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) following 5-10 days of initial therapy with a parenteral anticoagulant. Traditionally, warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, was used for stroke prevention in these individuals but effective use of this drug is limited by it's delayed onset, narrow therapeutic window, need for regular monitoring and INR testing, and numerous drug-drug and drug-food interactions. This has prompted enthusiasm for newer agents such as dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban for effective clot prevention. In addition to once daily dosing, the benefits over warfarin also include significant reductions in hemorrhagic stroke and GI bleeding, and improved compliance, which is beneficial as many patients will be on lifelong therapy. Edoxaban is a selective inhibitor of factor Xa, a serine endopeptidase of the clotting cascade required for cleavage of prothrombin into thrombin. In vitro plasma protein binding is ~55%. Administration of edoxaban results in prolongation of clotting time tests such as aPTT (activated partial thromboplastin time), PT (prothrombin time), and INR (international normalized ratio). Edoxaban is indicated for reducing the risk of stroke and systemic embolism (SE) in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). However, it should not be used in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCL) > 95 mL/min because of increased risk of ischemic stroke compared to warfarin at the highest dose studied (60 mg). It is also indicated for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) following 5-10 days of initial therapy with a parenteral anticoagulant.\"\n",
      "Cilazapril_(16693),\"Cilazapril belongs to drug node. Cilazapril is an ACE inhibtor class drug used in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. It belongs to the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) class of drugs. It is a prodrug that is hydrolyzed after absorption to its main metabolite cilazaprilat. It is branded as Inhibace in Canada and other countries, Vascace and Dynorm in a number of European countries, among many other names. None of these varieties are available in the United States. Cilazapril is a pyridazine ACE inhibitor. It competes with angiotensin I for binding at the angiotensin-converting enzyme, blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. As angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor and a negative feedback mediator for renin activity, lower angiotensin II levels results in a decrease in blood pressure, an increase in renin activity, and stimulation of baroreceptor reflex mechanisms. Kininase II, an enzyme which degrades the vasodilator bradykinin, is identical to ACE and may also be inhibited. Maximum ACE inhibition is greater than 90% after 1 to 5 mg cilazapril. Maximum ACE inhibition is 70 to 80% after 0.5 mg cilazapril. Dose proportionality is observed following the administration of 1 to 5 mg cilazapril. Apparent non-proportionality is observed at 0.5 mg reflective of the binding to ACE. The higher doses of cilazapril are associated with longer duration of maximum ACE inhibition.  Cilazapril inhibits the production angiotensin II. By doing so, it decreases sodium and water reabsorption (via aldosterone) and it decreases vasoconstriction. The combined effect of this is a decrease in vascular resistance, and therefore, blood pressure. The absolute bioavailability of cilazaprilat after oral administration of cilazapril is 57% based on urinary recovery data. (The absolute bioavailability of cilazaprilat after oral administration of cilazaprilat is 19%.) Ingestion of food immediately before the administration of cilazapril reduces the average peak plasma concentration of cilazaprilat by 29%, delays the peak by one hour and reduces the bioavailability of cilazaprilat by 14%. These pharmacokinetic changes have little influence on plasma ACE inhibition.  Cilazapril is an ACE inhibtor class drug used in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure.\"\n",
      "Mimosine_(16743),\"Mimosine belongs to drug node. Mimosine is an antineoplastic alanine-substituted pyridine derivative isolated from _Leucena glauca_. Mimosine causes inhibition of DNA replication, changes in the progression of the cells in the cell cycle, and apoptosis. Mimosine appears to introduce breaks into DNA. Mimosine is an iron/zinc chelator. Iron depletion induces DNA double-strand breaks in treated cells, and activates a DNA damage response that results in focal phosphorylation of histones. This leads to inhibition of DNA replication and/or DNA elongation. Some studies indicate that mimosine prevents the initiation of DNA replication, whereas other studies indicate that mimosine disrupts elongation of the replication fork by impairing deoxyribonucleotide synthesis by inhibiting the activity of the iron-dependent enzyme ribonucleotide reductase and the transcription of the cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase gene (SHMT). Inhibition of serine hydroxymethyltransferase is moderated by a zinc responsive unit located in front of the SHMT gene. >99.5% Mimosine inhibits DNA synthesis at the level of elongation of nascent chains by altering deoxyribonucleotide metabolism. It arrests the cell cycle in the late G(1) phase. \"\n",
      "Lenalidomide_(16753),\"Lenalidomide belongs to drug node. Lenalidomide (initially known as CC-5013 and marketed as Revlimid® by Celgene) is a derivative of thalidomide introduced in 2004. It was initially intended as a treatment for multiple myeloma, for which thalidomide is an accepted therapeutic modality, but has also shown efficacy in the hematological disorders known as the myelodysplastic syndromes. FDA approved on December 27, 2005. The mechanism of action of lenalidomide remains to be fully characterized, however it has been demonstrated that lenalidomide inhibits the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), but not COX-1, in vitro. In vivo it induces tumor cell apoptosis directly and indirectly by inhibition of bone marrow stromal cell support, by anti-angiogenic and anti-osteoclastogenic effects, and by immunomodulatory activity 30% protein bound.  Lenalidomide, a thalidomide analogue, is an immunomodulatory agent possessing immunomodulatory and antiangiogenic properties. Lenalidomide inhibits the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increases the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Lenalidomide inhibits cell proliferation with varying effectiveness (IC50s) in some but not all cell lines. Lenalidomide is effective in inhibiting growth of Namalwa cells (a human B cell lymphoma cell line with a deletion of one chromosome 5) but is much less effective in inhibiting growth of KG-1 cells (human myeloblastic cell line, also with a deletion of one chromosome 5) and other cell lines without chromosome 5 deletions. Lenalidomide does not prolong the QTc interval.  Lenalidomide is indicated for the treatment of multiple myeloma in combination with dexamethasone. It is also indicated for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to low- or intermediate- risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities.\"\n",

      "Loxicodegol_(17166),\"Loxicodegol belongs to drug node. Loxicodegol was developed by Nektar Therapeutics as an opioid analgesic with low abuse potential for the treatment of chronic pain. The lack of abuse potential is believed to be due to the drug's slow rate of entry into brain, a unique characteristic compared to others in the opioid class. This is also thought to be the reason behind the reduced frequency of CNS-mediated adverse effects, like sedation, seen with Loxicodegol. Nektar Therapeutics has filed an application for FDA approval of Loxicodegol for use in the treatment of chronic lower back pain  Loxicodegol is a full agonist at the μ-opioid receptor. It also displays selectivity towards this subtype with an affinity of 237 nM compared to 4150 nM and >100000 nM for the δ- and κ-opioid receptors. The μ-opioid receptor is activated with an EC₅₀ of 12.5 μM. Activation of this receptor produces an inhibitory effect on neurotransmission through Gi/Go coupling. Opioid medications like Loxicodegol inhibit voltage gated Ca²⁺ channel opening presynaptically on C fibres and activate inward-rectifying K⁺ channels post-synaptically on 2nd order neurons, leading to hyperpolarization. Together, these prevent the nociceptive signal from traveling up the spinal cord to the brain. In the brain, opioids work through a mechanism of inhibition of inhibition to allow regulatory neurons to suppress nociception.   Loxicodegol displays full analgesic activity comparable to that of oxycodone, producing similar acetone-writhing test responses in mice and hot-plate test maximal latencies in rats. Loxicodegol was developed as an opioid analgesic with low abuse potential for use in treating chronic pain.

Cetirizine, a metabolite of _hydroxyzine_, is an antihistamine drug. Its main effects are achieved through selective inhibition of peripheral H1 receptors. The antihistamine activity of cetirizine has been shown in a variety of animal and human models. _In vivo_ and _ex vivo_ animal models have shown insignificant anticholinergic and antiserotonergic effects. In clinical studies, however, dry mouth was found to be more frequent with cetirizine than with a placebo. In vitro receptor binding studies have demonstrated no detectable affinity of cetirizine for histamine receptors other than the H1 receptors. Studies with radiolabeled cetirizine administration in the rat have demonstrated insignificant penetration into the brain. _Ex vivo_ studies in the mouse have shown that systemically administered cetirizine does not occupy cerebral H1 receptors significantly. The mean plasma protein binding of cetirizine is 93%. **General effects and respiratory effects** **Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis**: Indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis caused by allergens such as ragweed, grass and tree pollens in adults and children 2 years of age and above.

      "Desloratadine_(17237),\"Desloratadine belongs to drug node. Desloratadine is a second generation, tricyclic antihistamine that which has a selective and peripheral H1-antagonist action. It is the active descarboethoxy metabolite of loratidine (a second generation histamine). Desloratidine has a long-lasting effect and does not cause drowsiness because it does not readily enter the central nervous system. Like other H1-blockers, Desloratadine competes with free histamine for binding at H<sub>1</sub>-receptors in the GI tract, uterus, large blood vessels, and bronchial smooth muscle. This blocks the action of endogenous histamine, which subsequently leads to temporary relief of the negative symptoms (eg. nasal congestion, watery eyes) brought on by histamine. Desloratadine is bound approximately 82 to 87% to plasma proteins, while its active metabolite, 3-hydroxydesloratadine, is bound approximately 85 to 89%. Desloratadine is a long-acting second-generation H<sub>1</sub>-receptor antagonist which has a selective and peripheral H1-antagonist action. Histamine is a chemical that causes many of the signs that are part of allergic reactions, such as the swelling of tissues. Histamine is released from histamine-storing cells (mast cells) and attaches to other cells that have receptors for histamine. The attachment of the histamine to the receptors causes the cell to be \\activated,\\\"\" releasing other chemicals which produce the effects that we associate with allergies. Desloratadine blocks one type of receptor for histamine (the H1 receptor) and thus prevents activation of cells by histamine. Unlike most other antihistamines, Desloratadine does not enter the brain from the blood and, therefore, does not cause drowsiness.\"\" For the relief of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis, perennial (non-seasonal) allergic rhinitis. Desloratidine is also used for the sympomatic treatment of pruritus and urticaria (hives) associated with chronic idiopathic urticaria.\"\n",

      "Ergotamine_(15458),\"Ergotamine belongs to drug node. A vasoconstrictor found in ergot of Central Europe. It is an alpha-1 selective adrenergic agonist and is commonly used in the treatment of migraine disorders. Ergotamine acts on migraine by one of two proposed mechanisms: 1) activation of 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors located on intracranial blood vessels, including those on arterio-venous anastomoses, leads to vasoconstriction, which correlates with the relief of migraine headache, and 2) activation of 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors on sensory nerve endings of the trigeminal system results in the inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release.  Ergotamine is a vasoconstrictor and alpha adrenoreceptor antagonist. The pharmacological properties of ergotamine are extremely complex; some of its actions are unrelated to each other, and even mutually antagonistic. The drug has partial agonist and/or antagonist activity against tryptaminergic, dopaminergic and alpha adrenergic receptors depending upon their site, and it is a highly active uterine stimulant. It causes constriction of peripheral and cranial blood vessels and produces depression of central vasomotor centers. The pain of a migraine attack is believed to be due to greatly increased amplitude of pulsations in the cranial arteries, especially the meningeal branches of the external carotid artery. Ergotamine reduces extracranial blood flow, causes a decline in the amplitude of pulsation in the cranial arteries, and decreases hyperperfusion of the territory of the basilar artery.

Esomeprazole, sold under the brand name Nexium, is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) medication used for the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), for gastric protection to prevent recurrence of stomach ulcers or gastric damage from chronic use of NSAIDs, and for the treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions including Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) Syndrome. It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including , , and , for example. Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including , , , , and. Esomeprazole is the s-isomer of , which is a racemate of the S- and R-etiomer. Esomeprazole has been shown to inhibit acid secretion to a similar extent as , without any significant differences between the two compounds _in vitro_.  Esomeprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of esomeprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, esomeprazole's duration of antisecretory effect that persists longer than 24 hours. Esomeprazole is 97% bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range of 2 to 20 µmol/L. Esomeprazole is a compound that inhibits gastric acid secretion and is indicated in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the healing of erosive esophagitis, and <i>H. pylori</i> eradication to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence. Esomeprazole belongs to a new class of antisecretory compounds, the substituted benzimidazoles, that do not exhibit anticholinergic or H2 histamine antagonistic properties, but that suppress gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. By doing so, it inhibits acid secretion into the gsatric lumen. This effect is dose-related and leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus.

      "Conivaptan_(15470),\"Conivaptan belongs to drug node. Conivaptan is a non-peptide inhibitor of antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin). It was approved in 2004 for hyponatremia (low blood sodium levels) caused by syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Conivaptan inhibits both isotypes of the vasopressin receptor (V1a and V2). Conivaptan is a dual AVP antagonist with omolar affinity for human arginine vasopressin V<sub>1A</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> receptors <i>in vitro</i>. This antagonism occurs in the renal collecting ducts, resulting in aquaresis, or excretion of free water.  99% Conivaptan is a nonpeptide, dual antagonist of arginine vasopressin (AVP) V<sub>1A</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> receptors. The level of AVP in circulating blood is critical for the regulation of water and electrolyte balance and is usually elevated in both euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. The AVP effect is mediated through V<sub>2</sub> receptors, which are functionally coupled to aquaporin channels in the apical membrane of the collecting ducts of the kidney. These receptors help to maintain plasma osmolality within the normal range by increasing permeability of the renal collecting ducts to water. Vasopressin also causes vasoconstriction through its actions on vascular <sub>1A</sub> receptors. The predomit pharmacodynamic effect of conivaptan in the treatment of hyponatremia is through its V<sub>2</sub> antagonism of AVP in the renal collecting ducts, an effect that results in aquaresis, or excretion of free water. Conivaptan's antagonist activity on V<sub>1A</sub> receptors may also cause splanchnic vasodilation, resulting in possible hypotension or variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis. The pharmacodynamic effects of conivaptan include increased free water excretion (i.e., effective water clearance ) generally accompanied by increased net fluid loss, increased urine output, and decreased urine osmolality.

      "Ezetimibe_(15477),\"Ezetimibe belongs to drug node. Ezetimibe is a lipid-lowering compound that inhibits intestinal cholesterol and phytosterol absorption. The discovery and research of this drug began in the early 1990s, after the intravenous administration of radiolabelled ezetimibe in rats revealed that it was being localized within enterocytes of the intestinal villi - this prompted studies investigating the effect of ezetimibe on intestinal cholesterol absorption. Ezetimibe is used as an adjunctive therapy to a healthy diet to lower cholesterol levels in primary hyperlipidemia, mixed hyperlipidemia, homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), and homozygous sitosterolemia (phytosterolemia). Ezetimibe mediates its blood cholesterol-lowering effect via selectively inhibiting the absorption of cholesterol and phytosterol by the small intestine without altering the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and nutrients. The primary target of ezetimibe is the cholesterol transport protein Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) protein. NPC1L1 is expressed on enterocytes/gut lumen (apical) as well as the hepatobiliary (canalicular) interface and plays a role in facilitating internalization of free cholesterol into the enterocyte in conjunction with the adaptor protein 2 (AP2) complex and clathrin. Once cholesterol in the gut lumen or bile is incorporated into the cell membrane of enterocytes, it binds to the sterol-sensing domain of NPC1L1 and forms a NPC1L1/cholesterol complex. The complex is then internalized or endocytosed by joining to AP2 clathrin, forming a vesicle complex that is translocated for storage in the endocytic recycling compartment. Ezetimibe and ezetimibe-glucuronide are >90% bound to human plasma proteins. The mean _in vitro_ protein binding ranged from 99.5% to 99.8% for ezetimibe and 87.8% to 92.0% for ezetimibe-glucuronide. Ezetimibe was shown to reduce the levels of total cholesterol (total-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apoprotein B (Apo B), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and triglycerides (TG), and increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with hyperlipidemia. This therapeutic effect was more profound when ezetimibe was co-administered with a statin or fenofibrate compared to either treatment alone. In clinical trials involving patients with homozygous and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and in those with sitosterolemia, a recommended therapeutic dose of ezetimibe was effective in reducing the LDL levels by 15-20% while increasing HDL-C by 2.5-5%. Ezetimibe is indicated to reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and non-HDL-C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia, alone or in combination with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin). It is also indicated to reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, and non-HDL-C in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia in combination with fenofibrate, and to reduce elevated total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), in combination with atorvastatin or simvastatin. Ezetimibe may also be used to reduce elevated sitosterol and campesterol in patients with homozygous sitosterolemia (phytosterolemia).\"\n",
      "Topotecan_(15481),\"Topotecan belongs to drug node. An antineoplastic agent used to treat ovarian cancer. It works by inhibiting DNA topoisomerases, type I. Topotecan has the same mechanism of action as irinotecan and is believed to exert its cytotoxic effects during the S-phase of DNA synthesis. Topoisomerase I relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single strand breaks. Topotecan binds to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevents religation of these single strand breaks. This ternary complex interferes with the moving replication fork, which leads to the induction of replication arrest and lethal double-stranded breaks in DNA. As mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double strand breaks, the formation of this ternary complex eventually leads to apoptosis (programmed cell death). 35% Topotecan, a semi-synthetic derivative of camptothecin (a plant alkaloid obtained from the <i>Camptotheca acuminata</i> tree), is an anti-tumor drug with topoisomerase I-inhibitory activity similar to irinotecan. DNA topoisomerases are enzymes in the cell nucleus that regulate DNA topology (3-dimensional conformation) and facilitate nuclear processes such as DNA replication, recombination, and repair. During these processes, DNA topoisomerase I creates reversible single-stranded breaks in double-stranded DNA, allowing intact single DNA strands to pass through the break and relieve the topologic constraints inherent in supercoiled DNA. The 3'-DNA terminus of the broken DNA strand binds covalently with the topoisomerase enzyme to form a catalytic intermediate called a cleavable complex. After DNA is sufficiently relaxed and the strand passage reaction is complete, DNA topoisomerase reattaches the broken DNA strands to form the unaltered topoisomers that allow transcription to proceed. Topotecan interferes with the growth of cancer cells, which are eventually destroyed. Since the growth of normal cells can be affected by the medicine, other effects may also occur. Unlike irinotecan, topotecan is found predomitly in the inactive carboxylate form at neutral pH and it is not a prodrug. For the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in patients with disease that has recurred or progressed following therapy with platinum-based regimens. Also used as a second-line therapy for treatment-sensitive small cell lung cancer, as well as in combination with cisplatin for the treatment of stage IV-B, recurrent, or persistent cervical cancer not amenable to curative treatment with surgery and/or radiation therapy.\"\n",

Inhibition of electron transport by atovaquone will result in indirect inhibition of these enzymes. The ultimate metabolic effects of such blockade may include inhibition of nucleic acid and ATP synthesis. Atovaquone also has been shown to have good <i>in vitro</i> activity against <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>. Atovaquone is extensively bound to plasma proteins (99.9%) over the concentration range of 1 to 90 &micro;g/mL. Atovaquone is a highly lipophilic drug that closely resembles the structure. Its inhibitory effect being comparable to ubiquinone, atovaquone can act by selectively affecting mitochondrial electron transport and parallel processes such as ATP and pyrimidine biosynthesis in atovaquone-responsive parasites. Cytochrome bc1 complex (complex III) seems to serve as a highly discriminating molecular target for atovaquone in Plasmodia. There is no significant risk for myelosuppression associated with atovaquone, making this drug a beneficial therapeutic agent for recipients of bone marrow transplantation. For the treatment or prevention of <i>Pneumocystis carinii</i> pneumonia in patients who are intolerant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Also indicated for the acute oral treatment of mild to moderate PCP in patients who are intolerant to TMP-SMX.\"\n",
      "Estramustine_(15492),\"Estramustine belongs to drug node. A nitrogen mustard linked to estradiol, usually as phosphate; used to treat prostatic neoplasms; also has radiation protective properties. Estramustine is a derivative of estradiol with a nitrogen mustard moiety. This gives it alkylating properties. In vivo, the nitrogen mustard component is active and can alklyate DNA and other cellular components (such as tubulin components) of rapidly dividing cells. This causes DNA strandbreaks or misscoding events. This leads to apoptosis and cell death. Also, due to the drugs estrogen component, it can bind more selectively to active estrogen receptors.  Estramustine is an antineoplastic agent indicated in the palliative treatment of patients with metastatic and/or progressive carcinoma of the prostate. Estramustine is a combination of estradiol with nitrogen mustard. In vivo, the nitrogen-mustard moiety becomes active and participates in alkylation of DNA or other cellular components.. This causes DNA damage in rapidly dividing cancerous cells leading to cell death and ideally, tumor shrinkage. For the palliative treatment of patients with metastatic and/or progressive carcinoma of the prostate\"\n",
      "Bromocriptine_(15493),\"Bromocriptine belongs to drug node. Bromocriptine mesylate is a semisynthetic ergot alkaloid derivative with potent dopaminergic activity. It is indicated for the management of signs and symptoms of Parkinsonian Syndrome. Bromocriptine also inhibits prolactin secretion and may be used to treat dysfunctions associated with hyperprolactinemia. It also causes sustained suppression of somatotropin (growth hormone) secretion in some patients with acromegaly. Bromocriptine has been associated with pulmonary fibrosis. The dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor is a 7-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor associated with G<sub>i</sub> proteins. In lactotrophs, stimulation of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor causes inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, which decreases intracellular cAMP concentrations and blocks IP3-dependent release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores. Decreases in intracellular calcium levels may also be brought about via inhibition of calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels, rather than via inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Additionally, receptor activation blocks phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK and decreases MAPK/ERK kinase phosphorylation. Inhibition of MAPK appears to be mediated by c-Raf and B-Raf-dependent inhibition of MAPK/ERK kinase. Dopamine-stimulated growth hormone release from the pituitary gland is mediated by a decrease in intracellular calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels rather than via adenylyl cyclase inhibition. Stimulation of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway leads to improvements in coordinated muscle activity in those with movement disorders.  90-96% bound to serum albumin Bromocriptine stimulates centrally-located dopaminergic receptors resulting in a number of pharmacologic effects. Five dopamine receptor types from two dopaminergic subfamilies have been identified. The dopaminergic D1 receptor subfamily consists of D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>5</sub> subreceptors, which are associated with dyskinesias. The dopaminergic D2 receptor subfamily consists of D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub> and D<sub>4</sub> subreceptors, which are associated with improvement of symptoms of movement disorders. Thus, agonist activity specific for D2 subfamily receptors, primarily D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> receptor subtypes, are the primary targets of dopaminergic antiparkinsonian agents. It is thought that postsynaptic D<sub>2</sub> stimulation is primarily responsible for the antiparkinsonian effect of dopamine agonists, while presynaptic D<sub>2</sub> stimulation confers neuroprotective effects. This semisynthetic ergot derivative exhibits potent agonist activity on dopamine D<sub>2</sub>-receptors. It also exhibits agonist activity (in order of decreasing binding affinity) on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)<sub>1D</sub>, dopamine D<sub>3</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>, and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors, antagonist activity on &alpha;<sub>2A</sub>-adrenergic, &alpha;<sub>2C</sub>, &alpha;<sub>2B</sub>, and dopamine D<sub>1</sub> receptors, partial agonist activity at receptor 5-HT<sub>2B</sub>, and inactivates dopamine D<sub>4</sub> and 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptors. Parkinsonian Syndrome manifests when approximately 80% of dopaminergic activity in the nigrostriatal pathway of the brain is lost. As this striatum is involved in modulating the intensity of coordinated muscle activity (e.g. movement, balance, walking), loss of activity may result in dystonia (acute muscle contraction), Parkinsonism (including symptoms of bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and flattened affect), akathesia (inner restlessness), tardive dyskinesia (involuntary muscle movements usually associated with long-term loss of dopaminergic activity), and neuroleptic maligt syndrome, which manifests when complete blockage of nigrostriatal dopamine occurs. High dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain causes hallucinations and delusions; these side effects of dopamine agonists are manifestations seen in patients with schizophrenia who have overractivity in this area of the brain. The hallucinogenic side effects of dopamine agonists may also be due to 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> agonism. The tuberoinfundibular pathway of the brain originates in the hypothalamus and terminates in the pituitary gland. In this pathway, dopamine inhibits lactotrophs in anterior pituitary from secreting prolactin. Increased dopaminergic activity in the tuberoinfundibular pathway inhibits prolactin secretion making bromocriptine an effective agent for treating disorders associated with hypersecretion of prolactin. Pulmonary fibrosis may be associated bromocriptine’s agonist activity at 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors.  For the treatment of galactorrhea due to hyperprolactinemia, prolactin-dependent menstrual disorders and infertility, prolactin-secreting adenomas, prolactin-dependent male hypogonadism, as adjunct therapy to surgery or radiotherapy for acromegaly or as monotherapy is special cases, as monotherapy in early Parksinsonian Syndrome or as an adjunct with levodopa in advanced cases with motor complications. Bromocriptine has also been used off-label to treat restless legs syndrome and neuroleptic maligt syndrome.\"\n",
      "Ergometrine_(15498),\"Ergometrine belongs to drug node. An ergot alkaloid with uterine and vascular smooth muscle contractile properties. Ergonovine directly stimulates the uterine muscle to increase force and frequency of contractions. With usual doses, these contractions precede periods of relaxation; with larger doses, basal uterine tone is elevated and these relaxation periods will be decreased. Contraction of the uterine wall around bleeding vessels at the placental site produces hemostasis. Ergonovine also induces cervical contractions. The sensitivity of the uterus to the oxytocic effect is much greater toward the end of pregcy. The oxytocic actions of ergonovine are greater than its vascular effects. Ergonovine, like other ergot alkaloids, produces arterial vasoconstriction by stimulation of alpha-adrenergic and serotonin receptors and inhibition of endothelial-derived relaxation factor release. It is a less potent vasoconstrictor than ergotamine. As a diagnostic aid (coronary vasospasm), ergonovine causes vasoconstriction of coronary arteries.  Ergonovine belongs to the group of medicines known as ergot alkaloids. These medicines are usually given to stop excessive bleeding that sometimes occurs after abortion or a baby is delivered. They work by causing the muscle of the uterus to contract. Used to treat postpartum haemorrhage and postabortion haemorrhage in patients with uterine atony. \"\n",
      "Sitagliptin_(15501),\"Sitagliptin belongs to drug node. Sitagliptin is an oral dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor used in conjunction with diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The effect of this medication leads to glucose dependent increases in insulin and decreases in glucagon to improve control of blood sugar. Sitagliptin was granted FDA approval on October 16, 2006. Inhibition of DPP-4 by sitagliptin slows DPP-4 mediated inactivation of incretins like GLP-1 and GIP. Incretins are released throughout the day and upregulated in response to meals as part of glucose homeostasis. Reduced inhibition of incretins increase insulin synthesis and decrease glucagon release in a manner dependant on glucose concentrations. These effects lead to an overall increase in blood glucose control which is demonstrated by reduced glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). 38%. Sitagliptin inhibits DPP-4 which leads to increased levels of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide(GIP), decreased levels of glucagon, and a stronger insulin response to glucose. Sitagliptin is indicated for the management of glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus along with diet and exercise.\"\n",
      "Posaconazole_(15502),\"Posaconazole belongs to drug node. Posaconazole is a triazole antifungal drug that is used to treat invasive infections by Candida species and Aspergillus species in severely immunocompromised patients. As a triazole antifungal agent, posaconazole exerts its antifungal activity through blockage of the cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme, sterol 14&alpha;-demethylase, in fungi by binding to the heme cofactor located on the enzyme. This leads to the inhibition of the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell membrane, and accumulation of methylated sterol precursors. This results in inhibition of fungal cell growth and ultimately, cell death. Posaconazole is highly protein bound (>98%), predomitly to albumin. Posaconazole is an antifungal agent structurally related to itraconazole. It is a drug derived from itraconzaole through the replacement of the chlorine substituents with flourine in the phenyl ring, as well as hydroxylation of the triazolone side chain. These modifications enhance the potency and spectrum of activity of the drug. Posaconazole can be either fungicial or fungistatic in action. For prophylaxis of invasive <em>Aspergillus</em> and <em>Candida</em> infections in patients, 13 years of age and older, who are at high risk of developing these infections due to being severely immunocompromised as a result of procedures such as hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), or due to hematologic maligcies with prolonged neutropenia from chemotherapy. Also for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis, including oropharyngeal candidiasis refractory to itraconazole and/or fluconazole. Posaconazole is used as an alternative treatment for invasive aspergillosis, <em>Fusarium</em> infections, and zygomycosis in patients who are intolerant of, or whose disease is refractory to, other antifungals.\"\n",
      "Cefradine_(15504),\"Cefradine belongs to drug node. A semi-synthetic cephalosporin antibiotic. Cefradine is a first generation cephalosporin antibiotic with a spectrum of activity similar to Cefalexin. Cefradine, like the penicillins, is a beta-lactam antibiotic. By binding to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located inside the bacterial cell wall, it inhibits the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins; it is possible that Cefradine interferes with an autolysin inhibitor.   \"\n",
      "Bezafibrate_(15510),\"Bezafibrate belongs to drug node. Antilipemic agent that lowers cholesterol and triglycerides. It decreases low density lipoproteins and increases high density lipoproteins. It is generally accepted that bezafibrate is likely an agonist of PPAR-alpha. However, certain other investigations have also suggested that the substance might also elicit some effects on PPAR-gamma and PPAR-delta too. 94-96% of bezafibrate is bound to protein in human serum. Bezafibrate is an antilipemic agent that lowers cholesterol and triglycerides. It decreases low density lipoproteins and increases high density lipoproteins. Bezafibrate lowers elevated blood lipids (triglycerides and cholesterol). Elevated VLDL and LDL are reduced by treatment with bezafibrate, whilst HDL-levels are increased. The activity of triglyceride lipases (lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipoproteinlipase) involved in the catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins is increased by bezafibrate. In the course of the intensified degradation of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (chylomicrons, VLDL) precursors for the formation of HDL are formed which explains an increase in HDL. Furthermore, cholesterol biosynthesis is reduced by bezafibrate, which is accompanied by a stimulation of the LDL-receptor-mediated lipoprotein catabolism. Elevated fibrinogen appears to be an important risk-factor, alongside the lipids, smoking and hypertension, in the development of atheroma. Fibrinogen plays an important role in viscosity, and therefore blood flow, and also appears to play an important role in thrombus development and lysability. Bezafibrate exerts an effect on thrombogenic factors. A significant decrease in elevated plasma fibrinogen levels can be achieved. This may lead, amongst other things, to a reduction in both blood and plasma viscosity. Inhibition of platelet aggregation has also been observed. A reduction in blood glucose concentration due to an increase in glucose tolerance has been reported in diabetic patients. In the same patients, the concentration of fasting and postprandial free fatty acids was reduced by bezafibrate. For the treatment of primary hyperlipidaemia types IIa, IIb, III, IV and V (Fredrickson classification) corresponding to groups I, II and III of the European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines - when diet alone or improvements in lifestyle such as increased exercise or weight reduction do not lead to an adequate response. Also for the treatment of secondary hyperlipidaemias, e.g. severe hypertriglyceridemias, when sufficient improvement does not occur after correction of the underlying disorder (e.g. diabetes mellitus).\"\n",

The functioning of this gene is implicated in a wide variety of inflammation-associated disease states, including suspectibility to diabetes mellitus and systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Elevated levels of the encoded protein have been found in virus infections, including COVID-19 (disease caused by SARS-CoV-2). [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2020].\"\n",
      "JAK2_(1618),\"JAK2 belongs to gene/protein node. JAK2 is Janus kinase 2. This gene encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a central role in cytokine and growth factor signalling. The primary isoform of this protein has an N-terminal FERM domain that is required for erythropoietin receptor association, an SH2 domain that binds STAT transcription factors, a pseudokinase domain and a C-terminal tyrosine kinase domain. Cytokine binding induces autophosphorylation and activation of this kinase. This kinase then recruits and phosphorylates signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. Growth factors like TGF-beta 1 also induce phosphorylation and activation of this kinase and translocation of downstream STAT proteins to the nucleus where they influence gene transcription. Mutations in this gene are associated with numerous inflammatory diseases and malignancies. This gene is a downstream target of the pleiotropic cytokine IL6 that is produced by B cells, T cells, dendritic cells and macrophages to produce an immune response or inflammation. Disregulation of the IL6/JAK2/STAT3 signalling pathways produces increased cellular proliferation and myeloproliferative neoplasms of hematopoietic stem cells. A nonsynonymous mutation in the pseudokinase domain of this gene disrupts the domains inhibitory effect and results in constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation activity and hypersensitivity to cytokine signalling. This gene and the IL6/JAK2/STAT3 signalling pathway is a therapeutic target for the treatment of excessive inflammatory responses to viral infections. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2020].\"\n",

These mental illnesses can often be accompanied by comorbidities such as depression and substance abuse, and can significantly impact the quality of life of patients and caregivers. Luckily, several treatment options for psychotic disorders have been introduced to market since the realization of chlorpromazine\\'s antipsychotic properties in 1952.  The effects of ziprasidone are differentiated from other antispychotics based on its preference and affinity for certain receptors. Ziprasidone binds to serotonin-2A (5-HT2A) and dopamine D2 receptors in a similar fashion to other atypical antipsychotics; however, one key difference is that ziprasidone has a higher 5-HT2A/D2 receptor affinity ratio when compared to other antipsychotics such as olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole. Ziprasidone offers enhanced modulation of mood, notable negative symptom relief, overall cognitive improvement and reduced motor dysfunction which is linked to it\\'s potent interaction with 5-HT2C, 5-HT1D, and 5-HT1A receptors in brain tissue. Ziprasidone can bind moderately to norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake sites which may contribute to its antidepressant and anxiolytic activity. Patient\\'s taking ziprasidone will likely experience a lower incidence of orthostatic hypotension, cognitive disturbance, sedation, weight gain, and disruption in prolactin levels since ziprasidone has a lower affinity for histamine H1, muscarinic M1, and alpha1-adrenoceptors.  Ziprasidone is extensively protein bound with over 99% of the drug bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin and alpha1-acid glycoprotein. Ziprasidone is classified as a \\\\second generation\\\\\" or \\\\\"atypical\\\\\" antipsychotic and is a dopamine and 5HT2A receptor antagonist with a unique receptor binding profile. As previously mentioned, ziprasidone has a very high 5-HT2A/D2 affinity ratio, binds to multiple serotonin receptors in addition to 5-HT2A, and blocks monoamine transporters which prevents 5HT and NE reuptake. On the other hand, ziprasidone has a low affinity for muscarinic cholinergic M1, histamine H1, and alpha1-adrenergic receptors.\" In its oral form, ziprasidone is approved for the treatment of schizophrenia, as monotherapy for acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes related to bipolar I disorder, and as adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate for maintece treatment of bipolar I disorder. The injectable formulation is approved only for treatment of acute agitation in schizophrenia.',\n",
