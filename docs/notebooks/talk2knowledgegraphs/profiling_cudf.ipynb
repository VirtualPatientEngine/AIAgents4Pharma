NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and-2 which are the enzyme responsible for producing prostaglandins (PGs). PGs contribute to inflammation and pain signalling. Diclofenac, like other NSAIDs, is often used as first line therapy for acute and chronic pain and inflammation from a variety of causes. Diclofenac was the product of rational drug design based on the structures of , , and. The addition of two chlorine groups in the ortho position of the phenyl ring locks the ring in maximal torsion which appears to be related to increased potency. It is often used in combination with to prevent NSAID-induced gastric ulcers. Diclofenac was first approved by the FDA in July 1988 under the trade name Voltaren, marketed by Novartis (previously Ciba-Geigy). Diclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 and -2, the enzymes responsible for production of prostaglandin (PG) G<sub>2</sub> which is the precursor to other PGs. These molecules have broad activity in pain and inflammation and the inhibition of their production is the common mechanism linking each effect of diclofenac. Diclofenac is over 99.7% bound to serum proteins, primarily albumin. It is undergoes limited binding to lipoproteins as well with 1.1% bound to HDL, 0.3% to LDL, and 0.15% to VLDL. Diclofenac reduces inflammation and by extension reduces nociceptive pain and combats fever. It also increases the risk of developing a gastrointestinal ulcer by inhibiting the production of protective mucus in the stomach. Diclofenac is indicated for use in the treatment of pain and inflammation from varying sources including inflammatory conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and akylosing spondylitis, as well as injury-related inflammation due to surgery and physical trauma. It is often used in combination with as a gastro-protective agent in patients with high risk of developing NSAID-induced ulcers.',\n",

It is a triterpene glycoside with glycyrrhetinic acid that possesses a wide range of pharmacological and biological activities. When extracted from the plant, it can be obtained in the form of ammonium glycyrrhizin and mono-ammonium glycyrrhizin. Glycyrrhizic acid has been developed in Japan and China as a hepatoprotective drug in cases of chronic hepatitis. From January 2014, glycyrrhizic acid as part of the licorice extract was approved by the FDA as an existing food sweetener. It was approved by Health Canada to be used in over-the-counter products but all the products are currently on the status canceled post marketed. Glycyrrhizic acid can be found in the alpha and beta forms. The alpha form is predomit in the liver and duodenum and thus, it is thought that the anti-inflammatory liver effect of this drug are mainly due to the action of this isomer. Glycyrrhizic acid anti-inflammatory effect is generated via suppression of TNF alpha and caspase 3. It also inhibits the translocation of NFkB into the nuclei and conjugates free radicals. Some studies have shown a glycyrrhizic-driven inhibition of CD4+ T cell proliferation via JNK, ERK and PI3K/AKT. Glycyrrhizic acid does not bind to any plasma proteins as it is not absorbed systemically. On the other hand, its main active metabolite, glycyrrhetinic acid presents a very large binding to serum proteins such as albumin. Glycyrrhizic acid was reported to present antiallergic, antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities as well as improvements in glucose tolerance.  Glycyrrhizic acid is widely applied in foods as a natural sweetener. As a therapeutic agent, is has been used in a vast variety of formulations as it is reported to be anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcer, anti-allergic, antioxidant, anti-tumor, anti-diabetic and hepatoprotective. Due to this properties, its indications have been: treatment of premenstrual syndrome, treatment of viral infections, anti-lipidemic and antihyperglycemic.

In Crohn's disease, any part of your small or large intestine can be involved, and it may be continuous or may involve multiple segments. In some people, the disease is confined to the colon, which is part of the large intestine. Signs and symptoms of Crohn's disease can range from mild to severe. They usually develop gradually, but sometimes will come on suddenly, without warning. You may also have periods of time when you have no signs or symptoms . When the disease is active, signs and symptoms may include: Diarrhea, Fever, Fatigue, Abdominal pain and cramping, Blood in your stool, Mouth sores, Reduced appetite and weight loss, Pain or drainage near or around the anus due to inflammation from a tunnel into the skin, Other signs and symptoms, People with severe Crohn's disease may also experience: Inflammation of skin, eyes and joints, Inflammation of the liver or bile ducts, Kidney stones, Iron deficiency, Delayed growth or sexual development, in children The exact cause of Crohn's disease remains unknown. Previously, diet and stress were suspected, but now doctors know that these factors may aggravate, but don't cause, Crohn's disease. Several factors, such as heredity and a malfunctioning immune system, likely play a role in its development. Immune system. It's possible that a virus or bacterium may trigger Crohn's disease; however, scientists have yet to identify such a trigger. When your immune system tries to fight off the invading microorganism, an abnormal immune response causes the immune system to attack the cells in the digestive tract, too. Heredity. Crohn's is more common in people who have family members with the disease, so genes may play a role in making people more susceptible.

This gene is a downstream target of the pleiotropic cytokine IL6 that is produced by B cells, T cells, dendritic cells and macrophages to produce an immune response or inflammation. Disregulation of the IL6/JAK2/STAT3 signalling pathways produces increased cellular proliferation and myeloproliferative neoplasms of hematopoietic stem cells. A nonsynonymous mutation in the pseudokinase domain of this gene disrupts the domains inhibitory effect and results in constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation activity and hypersensitivity to cytokine signalling. This gene and the IL6/JAK2/STAT3 signalling pathway is a therapeutic target for the treatment of excessive inflammatory responses to viral infections. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2020].',\n",

      "HNF4A_(279),\"HNF4A belongs to gene/protein node. HNF4A is hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha. The protein encoded by this gene is a nuclear transcription factor which binds DNA as a homodimer. The encoded protein controls the expression of several genes, including hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha, a transcription factor which regulates the expression of several hepatic genes. This gene may play a role in development of the liver, kidney, and intestines. Mutations in this gene have been associated with monogenic autosomal dominant non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus type I. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants encoding several different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2012].\"\n",
      "PPARG_(989),\"PPARG belongs to gene/protein node. PPARG is peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma. This gene encodes a member of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) subfamily of nuclear receptors. PPARs form heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and these heterodimers regulate transcription of various genes. Three subtypes of PPARs are known: PPAR-alpha, PPAR-delta, and PPAR-gamma. The protein encoded by this gene is PPAR-gamma and is a regulator of adipocyte differentiation. Additionally, PPAR-gamma has been implicated in the pathology of numerous diseases including obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis and cancer. Alternatively spliced transcript variants that encode different isoforms have been described. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].\"\n",
      "IL10RA_(1299),\"IL10RA belongs to gene/protein node. IL10RA is interleukin 10 receptor subunit alpha. The protein encoded by this gene is a receptor for interleukin 10. This protein is structurally related to interferon receptors. It has been shown to mediate the immunosuppressive signal of interleukin 10, and thus inhibits the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines. This receptor is reported to promote survival of progenitor myeloid cells through the insulin receptor substrate-2/PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway. Activation of this receptor leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1 and TYK2 kinases. Two transcript variants, one protein-coding and the other not protein-coding, have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2009].\"\n",
      "JAK2_(1618),\"JAK2 belongs to gene/protein node. JAK2 is Janus kinase 2. This gene encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a central role in cytokine and growth factor signalling. The primary isoform of this protein has an N-terminal FERM domain that is required for erythropoietin receptor association, an SH2 domain that binds STAT transcription factors, a pseudokinase domain and a C-terminal tyrosine kinase domain. Cytokine binding induces autophosphorylation and activation of this kinase. This kinase then recruits and phosphorylates signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. Growth factors like TGF-beta 1 also induce phosphorylation and activation of this kinase and translocation of downstream STAT proteins to the nucleus where they influence gene transcription. Mutations in this gene are associated with numerous inflammatory diseases and malignancies. This gene is a downstream target of the pleiotropic cytokine IL6 that is produced by B cells, T cells, dendritic cells and macrophages to produce an immune response or inflammation. Disregulation of the IL6/JAK2/STAT3 signalling pathways produces increased cellular proliferation and myeloproliferative neoplasms of hematopoietic stem cells. A nonsynonymous mutation in the pseudokinase domain of this gene disrupts the domains inhibitory effect and results in constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation activity and hypersensitivity to cytokine signalling. This gene and the IL6/JAK2/STAT3 signalling pathway is a therapeutic target for the treatment of excessive inflammatory responses to viral infections. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2020].\"\n",

This gene is a member of the leucine-rich repeat kinase family and encodes a protein with an ankryin repeat region, a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, a kinase domain, a DFG-like motif, a RAS domain, a GTPase domain, a MLK-like domain, and a WD40 domain. The protein is present largely in the cytoplasm but also associates with the mitochondrial outer membrane. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Parkinson disease-8. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].\"\n",
      "TNF_(2329),\"TNF belongs to gene/protein node. TNF is tumor necrosis factor. This gene encodes a multifunctional proinflammatory cytokine that belongs to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily. This cytokine is mainly secreted by macrophages. It can bind to, and thus functions through its receptors TNFRSF1A/TNFR1 and TNFRSF1B/TNFBR. This cytokine is involved in the regulation of a wide spectrum of biological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, lipid metabolism, and coagulation. This cytokine has been implicated in a variety of diseases, including autoimmune diseases, insulin resistance, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis ankylosing spondylitis, tuberculosis, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, and cancer. Mutations in this gene affect susceptibility to cerebral malaria, septic shock, and Alzheimer disease. Knockout studies in mice also suggested the neuroprotective function of this cytokine. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2020].\"\n",
      "LSP1_(2643),\"LSP1 belongs to gene/protein node. LSP1 is lymphocyte specific protein 1. This gene encodes an intracellular F-actin binding protein. The protein is expressed in lymphocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, and endothelium and may regulate neutrophil motility, adhesion to fibrinogen matrix proteins, and transendothelial migration. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].\"\n",
      "PRDM1_(2874),\"PRDM1 belongs to gene/protein node. PRDM1 is PR/SET domain 1. This gene encodes a protein that acts as a repressor of beta-interferon gene expression. The protein binds specifically to the PRDI (positive regulatory domain I element) of the beta-IFN gene promoter. Transcription of this gene increases upon virus induction. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants that encode different isoforms have been reported. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].\"\n",
      "CARD9_(3460),\"CARD9 belongs to gene/protein node. CARD9 is caspase recruitment domain family member 9. The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the CARD protein family, which is defined by the presence of a characteristic caspase-associated recruitment domain (CARD). CARD is a protein interaction domain known to participate in activation or suppression of CARD containing members of the caspase family, and thus plays an important regulatory role in cell apoptosis. This protein was identified by its selective association with the CARD domain of BCL10, a postive regulator of apoptosis and NF-kappaB activation, and is thought to function as a molecular scaffold for the assembly of a BCL10 signaling complex that activates NF-kappaB. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed, but their full-length nature is not clearly defined. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].\"\n",
      "MMP9_(3474),\"MMP9 belongs to gene/protein node. MMP9 is matrix metallopeptidase 9. Proteins of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family are involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix in normal physiological processes, such as embryonic development, reproduction, and tissue remodeling, as well as in disease processes, such as arthritis and metastasis. Most MMP's are secreted as inactive proproteins which are activated when cleaved by extracellular proteinases. The enzyme encoded by this gene degrades type IV and V collagens. Studies in rhesus monkeys suggest that the enzyme is involved in IL-8-induced mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells from bone marrow, and murine studies suggest a role in tumor-associated tissue remodeling. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].\"\n",
      "ABCB1_(4152),\"ABCB1 belongs to gene/protein node. ABCB1 is ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 1. The membrane-associated protein encoded by this gene is a member of the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. ABC proteins transport various molecules across extra- and intra-cellular membranes. ABC genes are divided into seven distinct subfamilies (ABC1, MDR/TAP, MRP, ALD, OABP, GCN20, White). This protein is a member of the MDR/TAP subfamily. Members of the MDR/TAP subfamily are involved in multidrug resistance. The protein encoded by this gene is an ATP-dependent drug efflux pump for xenobiotic compounds with broad substrate specificity. It is responsible for decreased drug accumulation in multidrug-resistant cells and often mediates the development of resistance to anticancer drugs. This protein also functions as a transporter in the blood-brain barrier. Mutations in this gene are associated with colchicine resistance and Inflammatory bowel disease 13. Alternative splicing and the use of alternative promoters results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2017].\"\n",
      "RIPK2_(4731),\"RIPK2 belongs to gene/protein node. RIPK2 is receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase 2. This gene encodes a member of the receptor-interacting protein (RIP) family of serine/threonine protein kinases. The encoded protein contains a C-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), and is a component of signaling complexes in both the innate and adaptive immune pathways. It is a potent activator of NF-kappaB and inducer of apoptosis in response to various stimuli. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].\"\n",
      "IL12B_(6168),\"IL12B belongs to gene/protein node. IL12B is interleukin 12B.

These mental illnesses can often be accompanied by comorbidities such as depression and substance abuse, and can significantly impact the quality of life of patients and caregivers. Luckily, several treatment options for psychotic disorders have been introduced to market since the realization of chlorpromazine\\'s antipsychotic properties in 1952.  The effects of ziprasidone are differentiated from other antispychotics based on its preference and affinity for certain receptors. Ziprasidone binds to serotonin-2A (5-HT2A) and dopamine D2 receptors in a similar fashion to other atypical antipsychotics; however, one key difference is that ziprasidone has a higher 5-HT2A/D2 receptor affinity ratio when compared to other antipsychotics such as olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole. Ziprasidone offers enhanced modulation of mood, notable negative symptom relief, overall cognitive improvement and reduced motor dysfunction which is linked to it\\'s potent interaction with 5-HT2C, 5-HT1D, and 5-HT1A receptors in brain tissue. Ziprasidone can bind moderately to norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake sites which may contribute to its antidepressant and anxiolytic activity. Patient\\'s taking ziprasidone will likely experience a lower incidence of orthostatic hypotension, cognitive disturbance, sedation, weight gain, and disruption in prolactin levels since ziprasidone has a lower affinity for histamine H1, muscarinic M1, and alpha1-adrenoceptors.  Ziprasidone is extensively protein bound with over 99% of the drug bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin and alpha1-acid glycoprotein. Ziprasidone is classified as a \\\\second generation\\\\\" or \\\\\"atypical\\\\\" antipsychotic and is a dopamine and 5HT2A receptor antagonist with a unique receptor binding profile. As previously mentioned, ziprasidone has a very high 5-HT2A/D2 affinity ratio, binds to multiple serotonin receptors in addition to 5-HT2A, and blocks monoamine transporters which prevents 5HT and NE reuptake. On the other hand, ziprasidone has a low affinity for muscarinic cholinergic M1, histamine H1, and alpha1-adrenergic receptors.\" In its oral form, ziprasidone is approved for the treatment of schizophrenia, as monotherapy for acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes related to bipolar I disorder, and as adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate for maintece treatment of bipolar I disorder. The injectable formulation is approved only for treatment of acute agitation in schizophrenia.',\n",
